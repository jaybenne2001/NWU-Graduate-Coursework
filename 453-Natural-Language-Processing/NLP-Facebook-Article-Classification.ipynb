      "<title>1.5m Users Hit By New Facebook Privacy Breach As Extent Of Data Misuse Exposed</title>\n",
      "Facebook's alleged data misuse hit the headlines (again) on Thursday as Business Insider revealed that the company had \"harvested the email contacts of 1.5 million users without their knowledge or consent when they opened their accounts.\" The privacy breach came to light when a security researcher questioned why Facebook was asking for email passwords when new users signed up with the platform. \"Business Insider then discovered that if you did enter your email password, a message popped up saying it was 'importing' your contacts, without asking for permission first.\"In addition to the obvious data misuse implications, for a commercial platform to request a password for a separate application breaks every security protocol imaginable. Forgetting the contact details that were then harvested, such a security breach would have left the email content itself open to misuse. The irony is that this concern will be dismissed because it's Facebook with the company's unique scale and reach. And yet it's Facebook that has lost significant user trust in recent months. If the company was prepared to download contacts without permission, why would it not also metadata tag email content inside those third-party services for commercial advertising purposes?This is the second data scandal to hit the company this week. On Tuesday, NBC reported that it had leaked documents showing that \"Mark Zuckerberg leveraged Facebook user data to fight rivals and help friends.\" The 4,000 pages of internal documents implicated Zuckerberg as well as Facebook's board and senior management in finding \"ways to tap Facebook’s trove of user data — including information about friends, relationships and photos — as leverage over companies it partnered with. In some cases, Facebook would reward favored companies by giving them access to the data of its users. In other cases, it would deny user-data access to rival companies or apps.\"The never-ending PR train wreckLast month, Facebook \"admitted exposing passwords belonging to hundreds of millions of users... storing them in a readable format within its internal data storage systems.\" This resulted in the passwords being searchable by employees.\n",
      "Now, in this latest privacy breach, Facebook has confirmed that \"last month we stopped offering email password verification as an option for people verifying their account when signing up for Facebook for the first time. When we looked into the steps people were going through to verify their accounts we found that in some cases people's email contacts were also unintentionally uploaded to Facebook when they created their account.\"'Unintentional' harvesting of user data without consent comes as an awkward time for a company under increasing scrutiny over its approach to securing and maintaining the security of its users. The number of people affected by this is not insignificant. \"We estimate that up to 1.5 million people's email contacts may have been uploaded,\" the company said. \"These contacts were not shared with anyone and we're deleting them. We've fixed the underlying issue and are notifying people whose contacts were imported. People can also review and manage the contacts they share with Facebook in their settings.\"\"But the facts are clear,\" the emailed statement claimed, \"we've never sold people's data.\" Really? Isn't commercializing user data the company's core business model?Friendly data tradingIn the separate revelations that Facebook had been leveraging user data as a currency, leaked documents appear to show that the company was prepared to trade away user data when it perceived there to be a commercial advantage. The picture painted is of a network of friendly tech giants conceiving of ways to commercialize the information gleaned from users on social media in an entirely non-transparent way. And this was made much worse because \"all the while, Facebook was formulating a strategy to publicly frame these moves as a way of protecting user privacy.\"The NBC investigation cited Amazon as an example where Facebook provided access to user data in return for advertising dollars on its platforms. \"In contrast with Facebook’s public statements, the company came up with several ways to require third-party applications to compensate Facebook for access to its users’ data, including direct payment, advertising spending and data-sharing arrangements.\" The company also looked at restricting access to data for companies it viewed as a competitive threat. Responding to the allegations, a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement that \"As we've said many times, Six4Three -- creators of the Pikinis app --cherry-picked these documents from years ago as part of a lawsuit to force Facebook to share information on friends of the app's users. The set of documents, by design, tells only one side of the story and omits important context.\"The leaked documents are the latest to emerge from Facebook's legal battle with Six4Three, the developer of the defunct app for searching out bikini-clad photos on the platform. In one email disclosed as part of the case, an employee at Facebook discussed shutting down apps that don't spend \"at least $250k a year to maintain access to the data.\" The documents disclosed as part of the court case were not redacted correctly and have been the source of multiple headlines, causing serious embarrassment for Facebook.Is regulation enough?A week ago, the U.K. announced proposals for \"tough new measures to ensure the U.K. is the safest place in the world to be online,\" claiming these to be the world's \"first online safety laws.\" The proposals included independent regulation with enforcement powers, and, critically, the potential for both social media companies and their execs to be held to account.As data breach after data misuse after privacy scandal hits, the question has to be asked as to whether regulation is enough. One could argue that the data harvesting and misuse is now so out of hand that something more drastic needs to be done. Whether that means changing leadership and ownership structures or mandating break-ups is open to debate.This week the LA Times reported that \"Facebook shareholders are getting fed up with Zuckerberg but can't do anything about him.\" The main issue is that Zuckerberg is not subject to governance best-practices at his company. “Facebook operates essentially as a dictatorship,\" according to one drafted shareholder proposal.And so the main question remains as to whether Facebook will ever open itself up to genuine change, if not government and regulators might need to do more than mandate content moderation. And country by country rules and regulations will mean little if the U.S. doesn't also take action.I am the Founder/CEO of Digital Barriers,  developing disruptive edge-AI video surveillance and analytics  for defense, security and  commercial organizations in the US...I am the Founder/CEO of Digital Barriers,  developing disruptive edge-AI video surveillance and analytics  for defense, security and  commercial organizations in the US\n",
      "<title>Facebook's Massive Security Breach: Everything We Know | WIRED</title>\n",
      "Up to 50 million Facebook users were affected—and possibly 40 million more—when hackers compromised the social network's systems.Facebook’s privacy problems severely escalated Friday when the social network disclosed that an unprecedented security issue, discovered September 25, impacted almost 50 million user accounts. Unlike the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a third-party company erroneously accessed data that a then-legitimate quiz app had siphoned up, this vulnerability allowed attackers to directly take over user accounts.The bugs that enabled the attack have since been patched, according to Facebook. The company says that the attackers could see everything in a victim's profile, although it's still unclear if that includes private messages or if any of that data was misused. As part of that fix, Facebook automatically logged out 90 million Facebook users from their accounts Friday morning, accounting both for the 50 million that Facebook knows were affected, and an additional 40 million that potentially could have been. Later Friday, Facebook also confirmed that third-party sites that those users logged into with their Facebook accounts could also be affected.\"We were able to fix the vulnerability and secure the accounts, but it definitely is an issue that it happened in the first place.\"Mark Zuckerberg, FacebookFacebook says that affected users will see a message at the top of their News Feed about the issue when they log back into the social network. \"Your privacy and security are important to us,\" the update reads. \"We want to let you know about recent action we've taken to secure your account.\" The message is followed by a prompt to click and learn more details. If you were not logged out but want to take extra security precautions, you can check this page to see the places where your account is currently logged in, and log them out.Facebook has yet to identify the hackers, or where they may have originated. “We may never know,” Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of product, said on a call with reporters Friday. The company is now working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to identify the attackers. A Taiwanese hacker named Chang Chi-yuan had earlier this week promised to live-stream the deletion of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook account, but Rosen said Facebook was \"not aware that that person was related to this attack.\"“If the attacker exploited custom and isolated vulnerabilities, and the attack was a highly targeted one, there simply might be no suitable trace or intelligence allowing investigators to connect the dots,” says Lukasz Olejnik, a security and privacy researcher and member of the W3C Technical Architecture Group.On the same call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated previous statements he has made about security being an “arms race.”“This is a really serious security issue, and we’re taking it really seriously,” he said. “I’m glad that we found this, and we were able to fix the vulnerability and secure the accounts, but it definitely is an issue that it happened in the first place.”The social network says its investigation into the breach began on September 16, when it saw an unusual spike in users accessing Facebook. On September 25, the company’s engineering team discovered that hackers appear to have exploited a series of bugs related to a Facebook feature that lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else. The \"View As\" feature is designed to allow users to experience how their privacy settings look to another person.The first bug prompted Facebook's video upload tool to mistakenly show up on the \"View As\" page. The second one caused the uploader to generate an access token—what allows you to remain logged into your Facebook account on a device, without having to sign in every time you visit—that had the same sign-in permissions as the Facebook mobile app. Finally, when the video uploader did appear in \"View As\" mode, it triggered an access code for whoever the hacker was searching for.“This is a complex interaction of multiple bugs,” Rosen said, adding that the hackers likely required some level of sophistication.That also explains Friday morning's logouts; they served to reset the access tokens of both those directly affected and any additional accounts “that have been subject to a View As look-up” in the last year, Rosen said. Facebook has temporarily turned off \"View As,\" as it continues to investigate the issue.“It’s easy to say that security testing should have caught this, but these types of security vulnerabilities can be extremely difficult to spot or catch since they rely on having to dynamically test the site itself as it’s running,” says David Kennedy, the CEO of the cybersecurity firm TrustedSec.The vulnerability couldn’t have come at a worse time for Facebook, whose executives are still reeling from a series of scandals that unfolded in the wake of the 2016 US presidential election. A widespread Russian disinformation campaign leveraged the platform unnoticed, followed by revelations that third-party companies like Cambridge Analytica had collected user data without their knowledge.\"There simply might be no suitable trace or intelligence allowing investigators to connect the dots.\"Security Researcher Lukasz OlejnikThe social network already faces multiple federal investigations into its privacy and data-sharing practices, including one probe by the Federal Trade Commission and another conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both have to do with its disclosures around Cambridge Analytica.It also faces the specter of more aggressive regulation from Congress, on the heels of a series of occasionally contentious hearings about data privacy. After Facebook’s announcement Friday, Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia), who serves as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for a “full investigation” into the breach. “Today’s disclosure is a reminder about the dangers posed when a small number of companies like Facebook or the credit bureau Equifax are able to accumulate so much personal data about individual Americans without adequate security measures,” Warner said in a statement. “This is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users.”Facebook may also face unprecedented scrutiny in Europe, where the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to disclose a breach to a European agency within 72 hours of it occurring. In cases of high risk to users, the regulation also requires that they be notified directly. Facebook says it has notified the Irish Data Protection Commission about the issue.This is the second security vulnerability that Facebook has disclosed in recent months. In June, the company announced it had discovered a bug that made up to 14 million people’s posts publicly viewable to anyone for days. This is the first time in Facebook’s history, though, that users’ entire accounts may have been compromised by outside hackers. Its response to this vulnerability—and the speed and comprehensiveness of the important disclosures ahead—will likely be of serious importance.

      "It can be hard to remember from down here, beneath the avalanche of words and promises and apologies and blogposts and manifestos that Facebook has unleashed upon us over the course of the past year, but when the Cambridge Analytica story broke one year ago, Mark Zuckerberg’s initial response was a long and deafening silence.It took five full days for the founder and CEO of Facebook – the man with total control over the world’s largest communications platform – to emerge from his Menlo Park cloisters and address the public. When he finally did, he did so with gusto, taking a new set of talking points (“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you”) on a seemingly unending roadshow, from his own Facebook page to the mainstream press to Congress and on to an oddly earnest discussion series he’s planning to subject us to at irregular intervals for the rest of 2019.The culmination of all that verbosity came earlier this month, when Zuck unloaded a 3,000-word treatise on Facebook’s “privacy-focused” future (a phrase that somehow demands both regular quotation marks and ironic scare quotes), a missive that was perhaps best described by the Guardian’s Emily Bell as “the nightmarish college application essay of an accomplished sociopath”.While it appears that Facebook is suddenly ‘woke’ to privacy issues, it’s safe to assume it’s business as usual thereThe so-called pivot to privacy is in many ways the logical conclusion to the earth-shaking (and market-moving) response to the Cambridge Analytica story, which plunged Facebook into the greatest crisis in its then 14-year history. After nearly a year of its critics demanding that it respect users’ privacy, here was Facebook saying: “Fine, privacy you shall have.” (More on whether what’s being offered is actually privacy later.)But it’s worth thinking back to those five days of silence, when the contours of the scandal took shape and revealed themselves with an uncanny distinction: when it came to Facebook, the Cambridge Analytica story did not uncover anything new. The basic facts had already been reported, in the same publication, 16 months previously: Facebook had allowed someone to extract vast amounts of private information about vast numbers of people from its system, and that entity had passed the data along to someone else, who had used it for political ends.What changed was how we saw those facts. It was as if we had all gone away on a long voyage, returned home to an uneasy sense that something was different, and were not immediately able to grasp that it was ourselves who had changed and not the rooms and furnishings that surrounded us.Facebook’s PR machine spent much of the first 24 hours after the story broke engaged in a pedantic and self-defeating argument over whether or not what had occurred constituted a “data breach”. By information security standards, Facebook was correct that what occurred was not a “data breach” – as representatives wrote, “no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked”.But a year later, and in the aftermath of an actual, vast data breach in October, it is apparent that a data breach would have been easier for Facebook’s reputation to weather. Almost every company has suffered a big data breach at this point; only Facebook has endured such an existential reckoning. That’s because what happened with Cambridge Analytica was not a matter of Facebook’s systems being infiltrated, but of Facebook’s systems working as designed: data was amassed, data was extracted, and data was exploited.At the end of 2018, Zuck debuted a new talking point, asserting that in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook had “fundamentally altered [its] DNA”.Whether Zuckerberg actually believes that is an open question, but it’s clear that few outside Facebook do. “While it appears that Facebook is suddenly ‘woke’ to privacy issues, it’s safe to assume it’s business as usual there,” said Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission.“They keep actually putting growth and profits above designing a platform that’s predicated on the needs of its users,” said Lindsey Barrett, a teaching fellow and staff attorney at Georgetown’s Communications and Technology Clinic. As a particularly blatant example of this mindset, Barrett cited Facebook’s insistence on using phone numbers that users provided for security reasons for non-security purposes.Zuckerberg did make a number of specific promises after the Cambridge Analytica story broke. I asked the company for an update on a number of these, and can only offer the Harvard dropout an “incomplete”.On 19 March 2018, Facebook said it was pursuing a forensic audit of Cambridge Analytica and other parties involved in the data misuse, but it stood down after the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) began its own investigation. A Facebook spokeswoman said on 13 March that the company was still waiting for approval from the ICO to perform any such audit.On 21 March 2018, Zuckerberg promised that Facebook would investigate “all apps that had access to large amounts of information” through the platform before 2014, audit any app with suspicious activity and ban any developer who misused personally identifiable information. Facebook provided regular updates on this investigation until 22 August 2018, when the company revealed in a blogpost that it had investigated thousands of third-party apps and suspended “more than 400”. Seven months later, a spokeswoman said that the investigation was continuing, but provided the same numbers: thousands investigated, more than 400 banned.On 1 May, Facebook made its most ambitious promise – the creation of a “clear history” tool that would allow users to force Facebook to delete all the information it gathers about users as they browse the web. At the time, Facebook said the tool would “take a few months to build”. As BuzzFeed News pointed out in February, it’s been more than a few months. A Facebook spokeswoman did not provide a timeline for when the tool might actually be available, saying that it was taking time to get the tool right.The other major promise – the big one – is the pivot to “privacy” announced this month. The actual details of this plan are much more mundane, and involve much less actual privacy, than Zuckerberg’s manifesto would like us to believe. The CEO is planning to integrate all three of his company’s messaging platforms – WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger – into one, which will have end-to-end encryption.The overwhelming consensus from privacy experts is that this plan has little to do with protecting privacy and everything to do with protecting market share. “They are incredibly adept at strategically using privacy as a justification for an anticompetitive strategy – and the shift to encrypted-messaging or ‘delete history’ makes sense when you consider the impending regulatory pressures around interoperability and data-portability,” said Soltani.The most obvious of those impending pressures is the increasingly popular idea of taking anti-trust action against Facebook, an idea that has gone from the fringes of the thinktank world to the center of a major 2020 Democratic presidential candidate’s agenda with dramatic speed.“Once the integration of those three messaging platforms happens, it will be almost technically impossible to break Facebook up,” said Jonathan Albright, director of the Digital Forensics Initiative at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. “It won’t happen. You can’t do it. And that’s exactly why they’re moving so quickly to do it.”That “Break Up Big Tech” would be a 2020 campaign slogan was unimaginable just two years ago. Zuckerberg, lest we forget, spent much of 2017 cosplaying a politician on his very own whistlestop tour around the country.And yet, here we are. The Cambridge Analytica revelations may not have changed Facebook, but they did change us. Our eyes are now open. The question is what we will do.\n"

      "<title>Facebook announces Libra cryptocurrency: All you need to know – TechCrunch</title>\n",
      "Facebook has finally revealed the details of its cryptocurrency, Libra, which will let you buy things or send money to people with nearly zero fees. You’ll pseudonymously buy or cash out your Libra online or at local exchange points like grocery stores, and spend it using interoperable third-party wallet apps or Facebook’s own Calibra wallet that will be built into WhatsApp, Messenger and its own app. Today Facebook released its white paper explaining Libra and its testnet for working out the kinks of its blockchain system before a public launch in the first half of 2020.Facebook  won’t fully control Libra, but instead get just a single vote in its governance like other founding members of the Libra Association, including Visa, Uber and Andreessen Horowitz, which have invested at least $10 million each into the project’s operations. The association will promote the open-sourced Libra Blockchain and developer platform with its own Move programming language, plus sign up businesses to accept Libra for payment and even give customers discounts or rewards.Facebook is launching a subsidiary company also called Calibra that handles its crypto dealings and protects users’ privacy by never mingling your Libra payments with your Facebook data so it can’t be used for ad targeting. Your real identity won’t be tied to your publicly visible transactions. But Facebook/Calibra and other founding members of the Libra Association  will earn interest on the money users cash in that is held in reserve to keep the value of Libra stable.Facebook’s audacious bid to create a global digital currency that promotes financial inclusion for the unbanked actually has more privacy and decentralization built in than many expected. Instead of trying to dominate Libra’s future or squeeze tons of cash out of it immediately, Facebook is instead playing the long-game by pulling payments into its online domain. Facebook’s VP of blockchain, David Marcus, explained the company’s motive and the tie-in with its core revenue source during a briefing at San Francisco’s historic Mint building. “If more commerce happens, then more small businesses will sell more on and off platform, and they’ll want to buy more ads on the platform so it will be good for our ads business.”In cryptocurrencies, Facebook saw both a threat and an opportunity. They held the promise of disrupting how things are bought and sold by eliminating transaction fees common with credit cards. That comes dangerously close to Facebook’s ad business that influences what is bought and sold. If a competitor like Google or an upstart built a popular coin and could monitor the transactions, they’d learn what people buy and could muscle in on the billions spent on Facebook marketing. Meanwhile, the 1.7 billion people who lack a bank account might choose whoever offers them a financial services alternative as their online identity provider too. That’s another thing Facebook wants to be.Yet existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum weren’t properly engineered to scale to be a medium of exchange. Their unanchored price was susceptible to huge and unpredictable swings, making it tough for merchants to accept as payment. And cryptocurrencies miss out on much of their potential beyond speculation unless there are enough places that will take them instead of dollars, and the experience of buying and spending them is easy enough for a mainstream audience. But with Facebook’s relationship with 7 million advertisers and 90 million small businesses plus its user experience prowess, it was well-poised to tackle this juggernaut of a problem.Now Facebook wants to make Libra the evolution of PayPal . It’s hoping Libra will become simpler to set up, more ubiquitous as a payment method, more efficient with fewer fees, more accessible to the unbanked, more flexible thanks to developers and more long-lasting through decentralization.“Success will mean that a person working abroad has a fast and simple way to send money to family back home, and a college student can pay their rent as easily as they can buy a coffee,” Facebook writes in its Libra documentation. That would be a big improvement on today, when you’re stuck paying rent in insecure checks while exploitative remittance services charge an average of 7% to send money abroad, taking $50 billion from users annually. Libra could also power tiny microtransactions worth just a few cents that are infeasible with credit card fees attached, or replace your pre-paid transit pass.…Or it could be globally ignored by consumers who see it as too much hassle for too little reward, or too unfamiliar and limited in use to pull them into the modern financial landscape. Facebook has built a reputation for over-engineered, underused products. It will need all the help it can get if wants to replace what’s already in our pockets.Here’s our zero-buzzword breakdown of Libra:By now you know the basics of Libra. Cash in a local currency, get Libra, spend them like dollars without big transaction fees or your real name attached, cash them out whenever you want. Feel free to stop reading and share this article if that’s all you care about. But the underlying technology, the association that governs it, the wallets you’ll use and the way payments work all have a huge amount of fascinating detail to them. Facebook has released more than 100 pages of documentation on Libra and Calibra, and we’ve pulled out the most important facts. Let’s dive in.Facebook knew people wouldn’t trust it to wholly steer the cryptocurrency they use, and it also wanted help to spur adoption. So the social network recruited the founding members of the Libra Association, a not-for-profit which oversees the development of the token, the reserve of real-world assets that gives it value and the governance rules of the blockchain. “If we were controlling it, very few people would want to jump on and make it theirs,” says Marcus.Each founding member paid a minimum of $10 million to join and optionally become a validator node operator (more on that later), gain one vote in the Libra Association council and be entitled to a share (proportionate to their investment) of the dividends from interest earned on the Libra reserve into which users pay fiat currency to receive Libra.The 28 soon-to-be founding members of the association and their industries, previously reported by The Block’s Frank Chaparro, include:Facebook says it hopes to reach 100 founding members before the official Libra launch and it’s open to anyone that meets the requirements, including direct competitors like Google or Twitter. The Libra Association is based in Geneva, Switzerland and will meet biannually. The country was chosen for its neutral status and strong support for financial innovation including blockchain technology.To join the association, members must have a half rack of server space, a 100Mbps or above dedicated internet connection, a full-time site reliability engineer and enterprise-grade security. Businesses must hit two of three thresholds of a $1 billion USD market value or $500 million in customer balances, reach 20 million people a year and/or be recognized as a top 100 industry leader by a group like Interbrand Global or the S&P.Crypto-focused investors must have more than $1 billion in assets under management, while Blockchain businesses must have been in business for a year, have enterprise-grade security and privacy and custody or staking greater than $100 million in assets. And only up to one-third of founding members can by crypto-related businesses or individually invited exceptions. Facebook also accepts research organizations like universities, and nonprofits fulfilling three of four qualities, including working on financial inclusion for more than five years, multi-national reach to lots of users, a top 100 designation by Charity Navigator or something like it and/or $50 million in budget.The Libra Association will be responsible for recruiting more founding members to act as validator nodes for the blockchain, fundraising to jump-start the ecosystem, designing incentive programs to reward early adopters and doling out social impact grants. A council with a representative from each member will help choose the association’s managing director, who will appoint an executive team and elect a board of five to 19 top representatives.Each member, including Facebook/Calibra, will only get up to one vote or 1% of the total vote (whichever is larger) in the Libra Association council. This provides a level of decentralization that protects against Facebook or any other player hijacking Libra for its own gain. By avoiding sole ownership and dominion over Libra, Facebook could avoid extra scrutiny from regulators who are already investigating it for a sea of privacy abuses as well as potentially anti-competitive behavior. In an attempt to preempt criticism from lawmakers, the Libra Association writes, “We welcome public inquiry and accountability. We are committed to a dialogue with regulators and policymakers. We share policymakers’ interest in the ongoing stability of national currencies.”A Libra is a unit of the Libra cryptocurrency that’s represented by a three wavy horizontal line unicode character ≋ like the dollar is represented by $. The value of a Libra is meant to stay largely stable, so it’s a good medium of exchange, as merchants can be confident they won’t be paid a Libra today that’s then worth less tomorrow. The Libra’s value is tied to a basket of bank deposits and short-term government securities for a slew of historically stable international currencies, including the dollar, pound, euro, Swiss franc and yen. The Libra Association maintains this basket of assets and can change the balance of its composition if necessary to offset major price fluctuations in any one foreign currency so that the value of a Libra stays consistent.The name Libra comes from the word for a Roman unit of weight measure. It’s trying to invoke a sense of financial freedom by playing on the French stem “Lib,” meaning free.The Libra Association is still hammering out the exact start value for the Libra, but it’s meant to be somewhere close to the value of a dollar, euro or pound so it’s easy to conceptualize. That way, a gallon of milk in the U.S. might cost 3 to 4 Libra, similar but not exactly the same as with dollars.The idea is that you’ll cash in some money and keep a balance of Libra that you can spend at accepting merchants and online services. You’ll be able to trade in your local currency for Libra and vice versa through certain wallet apps, including Facebook’s Calibra, third-party wallet apps and local resellers like convenience or grocery stores where people already go to top-up their mobile data plan.Each time someone cashes in a dollar or their respective local currency, that money goes into the Libra Reserve and an equivalent value of Libra is minted and doled out to that person. If someone cashes out from the Libra Association, the Libra they give back are destroyed/burned and they receive the equivalent value in their local currency back. That means there’s always 100% of the value of the Libra in circulation, collateralized with real-world assets in the Libra Reserve. It never runs fractional. And unliked “pegged” stable coins that are tied to a single currency like the USD, Libra maintains its own value — though that should cash out to roughly the same amount of a given currency over time.When Libra Association members join and pay their $10 million minimum, they receive Libra Investment Tokens. Their share of the total tokens translates into the proportion of the dividend they earn off of interest on assets in the reserve. Those dividends are only paid out after Libra Association uses interest to pay for operating expenses, investments in the ecosystem, engineering research and grants to nonprofits and other organizations. This interest is part of what attracted the Libra Association’s members. If Libra becomes popular and many people carry a large balance of the currency, the reserve will grow huge and earn significant interest.Every Libra payment is permanently written into the Libra Blockchain — a cryptographically authenticated database that acts as a public online ledger designed to handle 1,000 transactions per second. That would be much faster than Bitcoin’s 7 transactions per second or Ethereum’s 15. The blockchain is operated and constantly verified by founding members of the Libra Association, which each invested $10 million or more for a say in the cryptocurrency’s governance and the ability to operate a validator node.When a transaction is submitted, each of the nodes runs a calculation based on the existing ledger of all transactions. Thanks to a Byzantine Fault Tolerance system, just two-thirds of the nodes must come to consensus that the transaction is legitimate for it to be executed and written to the blockchain. A structure of Merkle Trees in the code makes it simple to recognize changes made to the Libra Blockchain. With 5KB transactions, 1,000 verifications per second on commodity CPUs and up to 4 billion accounts, the Libra Blockchain should be able to operate at 1,000 transactions per second if nodes use at least 40Mbps connections and 16TB SSD hard drives.Transactions on Libra cannot be reversed. If an attack compromises over one-third of the validator nodes causing a fork in the blockchain, the Libra Association says it will temporarily halt transactions, figure out the extent of the damage and recommend software updates to resolve the fork.Transactions aren’t entirely free. They incur a tiny fraction of a cent fee to pay for “gas” that covers the cost of processing the transfer of funds similar to with Ethereum. This fee will be negligible to most consumers, but when they add up, the gas charges will deter bad actors from creating millions of transactions to power spam and denial-of-service attacks. “We’ve purposely tried not to innovate massively on the blockchain itself because we want it to be scalable and secure,” says Marcus of piggybacking on the best elements of existing cryptocurrencies.Currently, the Libra Blockchain is what’s known as “permissioned,” where only entities that fulfill certain requirements are admitted to a special in-group that defines consensus and controls governance of the blockchain. The problem is this structure is more vulnerable to attacks and censorship because it’s not truly decentralized. But during Facebook’s research, it couldn’t find a reliable permissionless structure that could securely scale to the number of transactions Libra will need to handle. Adding more nodes slows things down, and no one has proven a way to avoid that without compromising security.That’s why the Libra Association’s goal is to move to a permissionless system based on proof-of-stake that will protect against attacks by distributing control, encourage competition and lower the barrier to entry. It wants to have at least 20% of votes in the Libra Association council coming from node operators based on their total Libra holdings instead of their status as a founding member. That plan should help appease blockchain purists who won’t be satisfied until Libra is completely decentralized.The Libra Blockchain is open source with an Apache 2.0 license, and any developer can build apps that work with it using the Move coding language. The blockchain’s prototype launches its testnet today, so it’s effectively in developer beta mode until it officially launches in the first half of 2020. The Libra Association is working with HackerOne to launch a bug bounty system later this year that will pay security researchers for safely identifying flaws and glitches. In the meantime, the Libra Association is implementing the Libra Core using the Rust programming language because it’s designed to prevent security vulnerabilities, and the Move language isn’t fully ready yet.Move was created to make it easier to write blockchain code that follows an author’s intent without introducing bugs. It’s called Move because its primary function is to move Libra coins from one account to another, and never let those assets be accidentally duplicated. The core transaction code looks like: LibraAccount.pay_from_sender(recipient_address, amount) procedure.Eventually, Move developers will be able to create smart contracts for programmatic interactions with the Libra Blockchain. Until Move is ready, developers can create modules and transaction scripts for Libra using Move IR, which is high-level enough to be human-readable but low-level enough to be translatable into real Move bytecode that’s written to the blockchain.The Libra ecosystem and the Move language will be completely open to use and build, which presents a sizable risk. Crooked developers could prey on crypto novices, claiming their app works just the same as legitimate ones, and that it’s safe because it uses Libra. But if consumers get ripped off by these scammers, the anger will surely bubble up to Facebook. Yet still, Calibra’s head of product tells me, “There are no plans for the Libra Association to take a role in actively vetting [developers],” Calibra’s head of product Kevin Weil tells me.Even though it’s tried to distance itself sufficiently via its subsidiary Libra and the association, many people will probably always think of Libra as Facebook’s cryptocurrency and blame it for their woes.Read our full story on the dangers of Libra’s unvetted developer platformThe real risk of Facebook’s Libra coin is crooked developersThe Libra Association wants to encourage more developers and merchants to work with its cryptocurrency. That’s why it plans to issue incentives, possibly Libra coins, to validator node operators who can get people signed up for and using Libra. Wallets that pull users through the Know Your Customer anti-fraud and money laundering process or that keep users sufficiently active for over a year will be rewarded. For each transaction they process, merchants will also receive a percentage of the transaction back.Businesses that earn these incentives can keep them, or pass some or all of them along to users in the form of free Libra tokens or discounts on their purchases. This could create competition between wallets to see which can pass on the most rewards to their customers, and thereby attract the most users. You could imagine eBay  or Spotify  giving you a discount for paying in Libra, while wallet developers might offer you free tokens if you complete 100 transactions within a year.“One challenge for Spotify and its users around the world has been the lack of easily accessible payment systems – especially for those in financially underserved markets,” Spotify’s Chief Premium Business Officer Alex Norström writes. “In joining the Libra Association, there is an opportunity to better reach Spotify’s total addressable market, eliminate friction and enable payments in mass scale.”This savvy incentive system should massively help ratchet up Libra’s user count without dictating how businesses balance their margins versus growth. Facebook also has another plan to grow its developer ecosystem. By offering venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz  and Union Square Ventures a portion of the reserve interest, they’re motivating to fund startups building Libra infrastructure.So how do you actually own and spend Libra? Through Libra wallets like Facebook’s own Calibra and others that will be built by third-parties, potentially including Libra Association members like PayPal. The idea is to make sending money to a friend or paying for something as easy as sending a Facebook Message. You won’t be able to make or receive any real payments until the official launch next year, though, but you can sign up for early access when it’s ready here.None of the Libra Association members agreed to provide details on what exactly they’ll build on the blockchain, but we can take Facebook’s Calibra wallet as an example of the basic experience. Calibra will launch alongside the Libra currency on iOS and Android within Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and a standalone app. When users first sign up, they’ll be taken through a Know Your Customer anti-fraud process where they’ll have to provide a government-issued photo ID and other verification info. They’ll need to conduct due diligence on customers and report suspicious activity to the authorities.From there you’ll be able to cash in to Libra, pick a friend or merchant, set an amount to send them and add a description and send them Libra. You’ll also be able to request Libra, and Calibra will offer an expedited way of paying merchants by scanning your or their QR code. Eventually it wants to offer in-store payments and integrations with point-of-sale systems like Square.The Libra Association’s e-commerce members seem particularly excited about how the token could eliminate transaction fees and speed up checkout. “We believe blockchain will benefit the luxury industry by improving IP protection, transparency in the product life cycle and — as in the case of Libra — enable global frictionless e-commerce,” says FarFetch CEO Jose Neves.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained some of the philosophy behind Libra and Calibra in a post today. “It’s decentralized — meaning it’s run by many different organizations instead of just one, making the system fairer overall. It’s available to anyone with an internet connection and has low fees and costs. And it’s secured by cryptography which helps keep your money safe. This is an important part of our vision for a privacy-focused social platform — where you can interact in all the ways you’d want privately, from messaging to secure payments.”By default, Facebook won’t import your contacts or any of your profile information, but may ask if you wish to do so. It also won’t share any of your transaction data back to Facebook, so it won’t be used to target you with ads, rank your News Feed, or otherwise earn Facebook money directly. Data will only be shared in specific instances in anonymized ways for research or adoption measurement, for hunting down fraudsters or due to a request from law enforcement. And you don’t even need a Facebook or WhatsApp account to sign up for Calibra or to use Libra.“We realize people don’t want their social data and financial data commingled,” says Marcus, who’s now head of Calibra. “The reality is we’ll have plenty of wallets that will compete with us and many of them will not be in social, and if we want to successfully win people’s trust, we have to make sure the data will be separated.”In case you are hacked, scammed or lose access to your account, Calibra will refund you for lost coins when possible through 24/7 chat support because it’s a custodial wallet. You also won’t have to remember any long, complex crypto passwords you could forget and get locked out from your money, as Calibra manages all your keys for you. Given Calibra will likely become the default wallet for many Libra users, this extra protection and smoother user experience is essential.For now, Calibra won’t make money. But Calibra’s head of product Kevin Weil tells me that if it reaches scale, Facebook could launch other financial tools through Calibra that it could monetize, such as investing or lending. “In time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass,” the Calibra team writes. That makes it start to sound a lot like China’s everything app WeChat.Facebook got one thing right for sure: Today’s money doesn’t work for everyone. Those of us living comfortably in developed nations likely don’t see the hardships that befall migrant workers or the unbanked abroad. Preyed on by greedy payday lenders and high-fee remittance services, targeted by muggers and left out of traditional financial services, the poor get poorer. Libra has the potential to get more money from working parents back to their families and help people retain credit even if they’re robbed of their physical possessions. That would do more to accomplish Facebook’s mission of making the world feel smaller than all the News Feed Likes combined.If Facebook succeeds and legions of people cash in money for Libra, it and the other founding members of the Libra Association could earn big dividends on the interest. And if suddenly it becomes super quick to buy things through Facebook using Libra, businesses will boost their ad spend there. But if Libra gets hacked or proves unreliable, it could cost lots of people around the world money while souring them on cryptocurrencies. And by offering an open Libra platform, shady developers could build apps that snatch not just people’s personal info like Cambridge Analytica, but their hard-earned digital cash.Facebook just tried to reinvent money. Next year, we’ll see if the Libra Association can pull it off. It took me 4,000 words to explain Libra, but at least now you can make up your own mind about whether to be scared of Facebook crypto.\n"

      "       last month in unveiling Libra, its new digital payment service. The company heralded it as “a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.” If fully launched, Libra would allow Facebook users to buy and sell goods and services around the world and across borders using a digital cryptocurrency governed by a collective in Switzerland. It would be linked to but distinct from the dollar, the euro and other currencies and maintained not by a government but by the behemoth Silicon Valley tech company.The reaction from governments around the world has been swift and negative. “My determination to make sure that Facebook’s…Libra project does not become a sovereign currency that could compete with the currency of states is…absolute,” declared the French finance minister. “Because I will never accept that corporations could become private states.” In the U.S., both the Senate and House held hearings and grilled Facebook executives. For his part, President Trump tweeted his objections to cryptocurrencies, “whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” It’s worth emphasizing that these are reactions to an initiative that has been announced but not implemented. The logic seems to be that, because Libra is new, untested and potentially disruptive, it should be banned or highly regulated lest it do harm. Distrust of Facebook and the other tech titans is also a factor, of course. Is the prospect of a wider role for Libra and other cryptocurrencies really so dark? True, these new technologies, if fully developed, could upend the monopoly of state-licensed banks, state-issued currencies and the tax and regulatory framework that undergirds them. They could place vast amounts of digital commerce beyond the reach of governments, which in turn could erode the ability of states to collect taxes and provide for the common good. But that’s not the end of the story. Like earlier technologies that seemed threatening at first, cryptocurrencies could be a great boon. Their wider adoption could create a parallel financial infrastructure that might unlock untapped global reserves, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the friction of banks, borders and exchange rates. Today’s layers of payment systems and banks all add time and costs. With Libra (and other cryptocurrencies), transactions become more seamless. Making myriad activities cheaper, faster and easier could facilitate economic activity in countries like India, where hundreds of millions of people remain outside the banking system. What governments lose in tax revenue on transactions that they can’t track might be regained from greater economic activity and prosperity.Remember that bitcoin, the progenitor of Libra and other cryptocurrencies, is only a decade old. Launched in 2009, bitcoin is based on what was then a novel software protocol known as the blockchain, which allows for each transaction to be authenticated and protected.Bitcoin is costly to mint and cumbersome to use, however, and so far lacks a killer app to make possible its wide-scale adoption. Hence the proliferation of myriad “alt-coins” such as Ethereum, whose champions tout their advantages over bitcoin. The result of this early competition was a speculative bubble that crested at the end of 2017, with the price of an individual bitcoin rising to almost $20,000, along with equally vertiginous gains for other cryptocurrencies. Their total global market capitalization grew to nearly $800 billion. Today, it hovers below $300 billion.Until now, the market for cryptocurrencies has been dominated by a few large investors. Libra has the potential to be a step change. Two of the limitations of crypto have been the difficulty of using it and its unsettling volatility. By embedding Libra in a social network platform with more than 2 billion users globally and attaching the value of the coins to a basket of existing currencies, Facebook could solve that challenge.\n",

      "        You could be on your computer in Austin, see an ad on Facebook for a perfume being sold in Paris and buy it with no link to any bank account. \n",
      "        ”\n",
      "Today, if an American wants to hire a team of software engineers in Bangalore, there are multiple ways to do it, using apps that connect them and payment services to provide for funds. But behind such transactions is an architecture of payments, exchange rates, licensed and regulated banks, and government rules, all of which add costs and friction.Now imagine a world where that transaction exists entirely on a social network platform. You could hire someone to do data entry in India or Nigeria or Indonesia who doesn’t have a bank account but does have a social media account. You could be on your computer in Austin, see an ad on Facebook for a perfume being sold in a Paris boutique and buy it using your Libra account, with no link to any bank account and no one collecting sales tax unless you declare it.That is far different from what exists today, even with payment services such as PayPal. Those services are almost all linked to banks, which in turn are regulated by governments. Libra can cut out that middleman and also make a range of transactions that much harder for governments to track and tax.In the long run, Libra and the legacy cryptocurrencies could potentially replace not just existing payment systems, not just traditional banking, but the sovereign power of states over currency. That is what politicians and regulators suspect and fear. For its part, Facebook says that is has no intention to overturn the current system, and its Libra consortium currently includes major payments players such as Visa and PayPal. The company is attempting to allay the concerns of both governments and established banks.\n",
      "But it’s fair to wonder where it all might go. One of the hallmarks of modern banks is the ability to issue credit; one of the capstones of modern state power is the ability to issue currency and to license and regulate banks. Libra at present isn’t a form of credit, and it is tied to a basket of currencies. You might be able to use Libra to buy a Xiaomi electric scooter or cellphone directly from a Chinese seller, but you won’t be able to pay your taxes with it. Why then are governments in such a tizzy? Because they understand that once in place, there may be no way to prevent a sophisticated, widely adopted cryptocurrency system from evolving into something much more far-reaching.Would that be a bad thing?States have been the foundation of economic prosperity for the past century. The creation of regulations governing the marketplace, the launch of a global monetary system after World War II, the taming of banks and the establishment of relatively stable currencies in affluent countries—all were part of the mix.No one would argue, however, that this system has solved all problems or that most societies are at peak prosperity. Will states and banks in their current form, or some new financial technology, lead to the next great wave of economic improvement? Libra may be a failure, or it may face so much opposition that it never launches. The fierce response to it is certainly a reflection of Facebook’s wider problems and the troubling history of cryptocurrencies. But it is also the reaction of a complacent establishment to a radical and potentially revolutionary technology. Perhaps it is time to shift our attention from the admitted risks of cryptocurrencies to the astonishing opportunities they could create. —Mr. Karabell is the author, most recently, of “The Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World.”  Where do you see the future of cryptocurrencies?

      "<title data-rh=\"true\">Facebook Agrees to Extensive New Oversight as Part of $5 Billion Settlement - The New York Times</title>\n",
      "AdvertisementSupported byBy Mike Isaac and Natasha SingerSAN FRANCISCO — Facebook was ordered on Wednesday to create new layers of oversight for its collection and handling of users’ data by the Federal Trade Commission, as the agency detailed a privacy settlement with the social network that became a referendum on how aggressive American regulators would be against big tech companies.Under the agreement, the F.T.C. mandated that the Silicon Valley company add new positions and practices to increase the transparency and accountability of how it treats people’s information. The agency also formally imposed a record $5 billion fine against Facebook for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data.Yet the measures, which the F.T.C.’s commissioners approved in a 3-to-2 vote this month, drew sharp criticism for not going far enough in curbing the data habits of the world’s largest social media company. Republican and Democratic lawmakers pilloried the settlement as a drop in the bucket for Facebook and said the F.T.C. failed to limit a core practice that has repeatedly raised privacy questions: the company’s gathering, sharing and use of people’s personal information.That puts American regulators in a difficult position as authorities around the world have stepped up their actions to crimp the power of tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Over the past few years, the United States has been seen as a lesser force in tech regulation, especially compared with European officials who have passed laws and imposed a series of large penalties against the tech giants.The F.T.C. agreement “utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way,” said Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri.Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is pushing for new federal privacy laws, said the settlement would not deter Facebook from further privacy violations.“The F.T.C. is sending the message that wealthy executives and massive corporations can rampantly violate Americans’ privacy and lie about how our personal information is used and abused and get off with no meaningful consequences,” he said.Within the F.T.C., the settlement was divisive, with the agency’s three Republican commissioners voting to approve the deal while the two Democratic commissioners dissented. The agreement stopped short of more punitive measures that the F.T.C. had previously discussed against Facebook, including holding the chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally liable for missteps and potentially taking the company to court. The fine was also a fraction of Facebook’s $56 billion in annual revenue.The agency also agreed the settlement would shield Facebook from known claims of violations before June 12, 2019, essentially giving the company a pass on its past. And it provided immunity to Facebook officers and directors.In a statement, the F.T.C.’s Republican commissioners — including the chairman, Joseph J. Simons — said they were “proud” of the agreement. The measures “will provide significant deterrence not just to Facebook, but to every other company that collects or uses consumer data,” they said.The F.T.C.’s two Democratic commissioners disagreed. “I fear it leaves the American public vulnerable,” said Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner.Rohit Chopra, another Democratic commissioner, warned that the terms of the settlement shielded Facebook from a wide range of problematic practices. “This shield represents a major win for Facebook, but leaves the public in the dark as to how the company violated the law and what violations, if any, are going unaddressed,” he said.Mr. Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post that the F.T.C.’s orders “go beyond anything required under U.S. law today.” He added that he supported the agreement because it would “reduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone.” Facebook will report its quarterly earnings later on Wednesday.The F.T.C. unveiled the settlement as lawmakers and regulators have recently ratcheted up pressure on Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.Last week, Congress held several hearings to question the companies on whether they were stifling free speech and competition. President Trump has weighed in, calling the tech platforms “crooked” and “dishonest” and saying “something is going to be done.” On Tuesday, the Justice Department said it would start an antitrust review into how internet giants had amassed market power and whether they had acted to reduce competition.Yet it’s unclear if those moves will lead to penalties or changes at the tech companies. That made the F.T.C. agreement the clearest indicator of how far American regulators would go to limit the firms.For Facebook, the F.T.C. settlement does not end its regulatory and legal headaches.The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it had imposed a penalty of $100 million against Facebook for making misleading disclosures to investors about the risks of misuse of user data. The agency charged that Facebook had known for two years about the misuse of users’ data — and had shared that information with company employees — yet misleadingly presented those risks to investors as merely hypothetical.And around the world, Facebook faces other fights. The authorities in Europe and elsewhere are lining up to probe and limit tech companies on issues including privacy, antitrust and harmful content such as disinformation and hate speech.The F.T.C.’s investigation of Facebook for privacy violations was prompted by a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London last year on how the social network allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm to the Trump campaign, to harvest the personal information of its users. Cambridge Analytica used the data to build profiles of American voters without the consent of Facebook users.The F.T.C. began examining whether the Cambridge Analytica scandal meant that Facebook had violated a 2011 privacy settlement with the agency. Under that earlier agreement, the company had agreed not to deceive people over how their information was used and shared.On Wednesday, the F.T.C. said it had also agreed to settle with Cambridge Analytica’s former chief executive, Alexander Nix, and Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who worked with the company. In contrast to the immunity the F.T.C. gave Facebook executives, the agency prohibited Mr. Nix and Mr. Kogan from certain business practices.With Facebook, the F.T.C. mandated the social network create an independently appointed privacy committee on its board that would review decisions affecting user privacy. The agency also ordered the company to designate compliance officers to oversee a privacy program, undergo regular privacy audits that Mr. Zuckerberg and others must submit to, and appoint an outside assessor to monitor the handling of data.During the discussions about the settlement with Facebook, one point of contention among the F.T.C. commissioners was whether it should shield Mr. Zuckerberg; Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg; and other Facebook executives and directors from any personal liability for the company’s transgressions. The Democratic commissioners argued the violations warranted holding the executives personally liable, while the Republican commissioners said new oversight would reduce the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg and others to make unilateral decisions.The Democratic commissioners also said that Facebook’s financial gains for violating its previous privacy commitments to the F.T.C. would far surpass the $5 billion fine that the agency was imposing.“When companies can violate the law, pay big penalties and still turn a profit while keeping their business model intact, enforcement agencies cannot claim victory,” Mr. Chopra said in his dissent.The three Republican commissioners said the $5 billion fine was “record breaking” and that it reset the baseline for privacy cases.They also said the F.T.C. did not have a strong enough case to move forward with any litigation against Facebook. Ultimately, Mr. Simons and the other two Republican commissioners, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, said the concessions they were able to extract with a settlement were more valuable — and far more certain — than what might be achieved with a drawn-out legal battle in public.“Is the relief we would obtain through this settlement equal to or better than what we could reasonably obtain through litigation?” they said. “If the answer had been ‘no,’ it would have made sense to aggressively move forward in court. The answer, however, was ‘yes.’ ”Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter: @MikeIsaac.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Natasha Singer from New York.Interested in All Things Tech?

But, if you're tired of feeling like Facebook is constantly eavesdropping on your conversations, there's a way to limit the social network's ability to target you with ads.You can hide ad topics, restrict which parts of your information advertisers can use and prohibit Facebook from using partners' data for targeting and more.I've pretty much turned off every possible way that Facebook advertisers can target me. The ads I see on my News Feed are all relevant to two primary things: my age and that I live in the U.S.I'm getting a more random assortment of ads, but Facebook feels a lot less creepy now. I'll show you how to control your ads, too.This is going to be your primary control panel for my guide. But let's get started by turning off three things in the  \"ad settings\" section.You should also limit which details Facebook can use to target ads, and you can do that by checking out two other sections in Facebook's ad settings.By now, you have already done a good deal to limit Facebook's ad targeting, but there's a lot more you can do. It just takes time. For starters, go to the  \"your categories\" portion of the \"your information\" section of the ad controls.Here you'll find a list of ways Facebook has categorized you. It might assume you're a  \"newlywed, \" for example. You can remove these categories by clicking on each one and tapping \"remove category.\" Unfortunately, there's currently no way to remove all the categories at once.Next, go to  \"advertisers and businesses.\" This section allows you to limit the data that individual companies upload to Facebook in order to target you. The key section is \"who have uploaded and shared a list with your info.\" This section contains a list of companies that uploaded ad targeting lists to Facebook that include your data, such as your phone number or email. These companies \"can share the ability to advertise to the list with advertisers on Facebook,\" but you have the power to limit that ability.For each company, tap on  \"view details\" and then \"advertisers using lists with your info.\" You can then select \"hide all ads from his advertiser\" for each one. Do this for each advertiser.Next, tap on the  \"advertisers and businesses\" section. The key sections are \"whose website or app you may have used,\" \"whom you've visited\" and \"whose ads you've clicked.\" Tap on each company that comes up to hide ads from them.

      "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11, 2018.Updated at 1:23 p.m. ETFacebook has a long track record in deception: telling people one thing, while doing another. That's according to federal regulators, at least one of whom says the government missed its chance to find out why the company has repeatedly misled its users. This past week, the Federal Trade Commission decided to enter into a settlement with Mark Zuckerberg without interviewing him first. The FTC secured a $5 billion penalty from Facebook but, FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra says, the agency sacrificed discovering the truth about the CEO in the process.\"It's still really a mystery to me as to what role [Zuckerberg] played,\" says Chopra, who opposed the settlement.The FTC complaint against Facebook highlights a prominent moment when Zuckerberg said one thing while his company did another. \"The thing is, we don't ever want anyone to be surprised about how they're sharing on Facebook. I mean that's not good for anyone,\" Zuckerberg told the audience of Facebook's annual F8 conference in 2014. Regulators at the FTC had investigated Facebook for taking the personal data of users and, without consent, handing it off to outsiders — third-party app developers. Following that and other embarrassing revelations, Zuckerberg made a promise. \"Now, everyone has to choose to share their own data with an app themselves,\" he said. \"We think that this is a really important step for giving people power and control.\"Sounds great. Only, it wasn't true. According to the FTC, Facebook kept handing over user data secretly — without consent — to dozens of outside developers (like Cambridge Analytica, the political research firm that worked on President Trump's campaign).  It wasn't the only time Zuckerberg misrepresented the truth. In 2018, he did it again — this time not on his own stage, but in front of the entire country.Zuckerberg — summoned to the U.S. Congress — apologized for enabling Russian interference in the American elections, for helping to spread fake news and hate speech, and for violating the privacy of users. \"It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well,\" he testified. \"And that was a big mistake, and it was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook. I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.\"Sounds great. Only, in the same month Zuckerberg gave that testimony (it was in April 2018), regulators say, the company began to use facial-recognition tracking on some 60 million users — again, without consent. The FTC's Chopra voted against entering the settlement with Facebook. \"We cut off this investigation too early, [and] Facebook was willing to pay more money in order to hide Mark Zuckerberg's testimony from this investigation,\" he says. Three Republican FTC members voted in favor of settling. The FTC extracted a $5 billion penalty from Facebook. Agency officials say that's more than the government would have gotten in court, if they'd litigated. Chopra, a Democrat, says his agency underplayed its hand, and missed the opportunity to uncover if Zuckerberg's misrepresentations were intentional. The FTC spoke to Zuckerberg's lawyers, but not to him. He was not required to answer questions or turn over his emails; and the settlement lets the CEO off the hook for the many privacy mishaps the FTC scrutinized. Zuckerberg did not personally face charges for violating an earlier settlement his company had reached with the FTC in 2011, though he could have been. \"Facebook fully cooperated with the FTC's investigation and provided tens of thousands of documents, files and emails—including from Mark Zuckerberg,\" Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, said in a statement Sunday after this story aired.The new FTC settlement includes provisions that could hold Zuckerberg liable, through civil and criminal penalties, for any future violations of the agreement with the commission.Zuckerberg's actions may stand at odds with the philanthropic, altruistic image he's worked hard to cultivate. CEOs break rules all the time. The ousted chief of Uber appeared to take pride in bulldozing his way into cities, assuming the laws that apply to cabs didn't apply to his operation. But Zuckerberg has worked very hard to project the image of model super citizen: Harvard dropout committed to connecting the world with an American brand that's more omnipresent that Coca-Cola; funding woefully neglected school systems; and conducting a listening tour to hear real people.(Facebook is one of NPR's financial sponsors.)It bothers Chopra that his agency didn't pursue the truth because Zuckerberg isn't just a CEO. He has structured the stock so that he controls the majority of votes in Facebook. Chopra explained in his written dissent that in other cases, when a chief calls the shots in a company, the FTC takes a hard look at them.\"We didn't even want to look at something that seemed fundamentally important, and instead traded it away for a higher fine, and none of that money will actually go to Facebook's users,\" Chopra says. The $5 billion goes to the U.S. Treasury, as mandated by law. Zuckerberg lauded the settlement, saying in a post that his company has a \"privacy-focused vision\" and that, while Facebook already works hard to protect people's privacy, \"now we're going to set a completely new standard for our industry.\" He did not mention that his company fought tooth and nail, according to regulators, against the fine and new external oversight the deal imposed on Facebook. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg's team is on Capitol Hill, trying to get permission to mint money — a new digital currency. This cannot succeed without the public trust. Facebook is making the case that lawmakers and regulators should trust it. But Chopra says he doesn't trust Zuckerberg or his company.

      "<title>Facebook AI Research Is A Game-Changer</title>\n",
      "For decades, computer programmers have been trying to beat multiplayer games by finding reliable patterns in data.Researchers at Facebook and Carnegie Mellon University published a whitepaper in Science Journal in July that flips this switch. Their software embraces randomness, and it is reliably beating humans at games.Smart bearded person in a classic gray suit is playing poker at casino in smoke sitting at the table with chips and cards on it . He is holding a glass of whiskey in his hand and looking away. Gambling addiction. Sincere emotions and entertainment concept.This is a big step forward for data science. It shows where the world is headed.By now, investors should know that machine learning and artificial intelligence have taken the enterprise world by storm. Companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix built huge platforms in internet search, ecommerce and media distribution by using software algorithms to understand what their customers wanted, sometimes even before they knew it.\n",
      "Collecting and understanding data is key.There have been big strides in programs mastering board games like checkers and chess. A super AI called AlphaGo, a prototype from Google Mind, even conquered Go, an extremely complex Chinese strategy game. It trounced Lee Sedol, the best Go player in the world, in a widely publicized match.Many software developers assumed Go was unassailable given the state of AI development.But AlphaGo caught Sedol off-guard. Developed by playing against itself millions of times, the software learned to be unpredictable. In the end, Sedol couldn’t determine why moves were being made.Pluribus, the Facebook and CMU collaboration, leans hard on being unpredictable. It makes sense.Whereas checkers, chess and even Go are limited to two players, poker traditionally involves more, creating a significant challenge for an AI. Exploiting the weaknesses of a single player would not be enough. Pluribus was designed to take on five world-class opponents simultaneously.With six players, six hands of cards, the bets, and the sheer multitude of possible outcomes, the game would have overwhelmed even the most robust supercomputer. Pluribus needed a reliable edge.The edge researchers used was counterfactual regret minimization.The big idea: During training, as Pluribus played against itself, the AI noted the outcome of games given all of the variables. Then, the software systematically played game after game, altering a variable each time.Pluribus learned that some moves, even crazy ones, were winners in defined circumstances. Flummoxed players, for example, would fold. And that is the key.We humans fidget nervously; we behave predictably when we are anxious. Professional poker players can spot these tells a mile away. Pluribus does not really play to its opponents’ weaknesses. It plays to its inherent strength — it has no tell. It is completely unpredictable.The proof is in the gameplay.Researchers set Pluribus up against world-class professional poker players, including Jimmy Chou, Seth Daniels, Michael Gagliano, Sean Ruane and Jacob Toole. In 10,000 hands of Texas Hold ‘Em with five other players, Pluribus won chips consistently, along with high praise from its human competitors.Ruane even marveled at its relentless consistency.The investment angle might not be immediately obvious. The story is not poker. It’s data science and progress.  Companies are now determined to do for their businesses what Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix did many years ago.Public cloud infrastructure is democratizing computer processing and data storage. And Software-as-a-Service companies are building bolt-on applications to turn mountains of corporate data into actionable insights.Alteryx Inc. makes the best-in-class platform for data scientists. Its ecosystem allows them to plug in data (often without coding), build models and perform predictive analytics to get insights fast using machine learning and AI.The Irvine, Calif., company logged a successful IPO in March 2017, offering 9 million shares at $14 on the New York Stock Exchange. At the time, Dean Stoecker, co-founder, told CNBC that legacy data analytics was completely broken and Alteryx was ready to fix that.It was a bold pitch, but Stoecker was on to something bigger — digital transformation. Companies are realizing that they are sitting on a goldmine of information locked inside their retail, manufacturing and supply chains . All that data could be mined to run the business more efficiently, and even build new business models.Banks are using the software to do derivatives and fraud modeling. Retailers are doing omnichannel analytics. Healthcare companies are working out genome sequencing. In a YouTube video, Stoecker says professional football teams are even using Alteryx to perform player analytics.Today, the company has technology partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle and Tableau, a data visualization company.Its customers range from Adidas and Dairy Queen to Johnson & Johnson, The Home Depot and Unilever.Alteryx was named a leader in the 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for data science and machine learning platforms. And it sits in the middle of a digital transformation stack that could be worth $15 trillion.Sales in the first quarter, which ended March 31, were $76 million, a 51% increase year over year. Gross profits were $68 million, and cash flow was $16 million. The company logged 2018 sales of $253 million, up 92.6% vs.  2017.The business is growing fast and that is being reflected in the share price. Alteryx shares are up 104% this year, and 209% during the past 12 months.Shares trade at 166x forward earnings and 26x sales. This stock is not cheap, but it’s the right stock for this era of new business models built with data.Growth investors should consider buying Alteryx into bouts of weakness.I am an  investment adviser, trader, columnist and author based in Seattle.

      "<title>Critics Pan Facebook's Privacy Settlement</title>\n",
      "Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg.So now it's official.The Federal Trade Commission has hit Facebook with the largest monetary penalty it has ever doled out in a privacy case, and the social network has agreed to a slew of new conditions around how it collects and users the data people share on its network.Facebook and the FTC, which spent months negotiating the settlement, naturally both hailed the agreement as a significant step forward for safeguarding users' information and protecting consumer privacy.The reaction within the community of privacy advocates was much more subdued.\"Too little, too late,\" Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center said of the settlement.EPIC noted that the FTC first began investigating Facebook's privacy practices in 2009, and reached a consent decree with the company in 2011 barring the company from making deceptive claims about its privacy practices. But in the intervening years, EPIC says it has unearthed some 26,000 consumer complaints made against Facebook since it reached that consent agreement.\"American consumers cannot wait another decade for the Commission to act against a company that violates their privacy rights,\" Rotenberg said, calling for Congress to pass legislation that would establish a new agency focused on data protection.Colin Stretch, Facebook's vice president and general counsel, said that the agreement with the FTC will amount to a \"fundamental shift in the way we approach our work.\"\"It will mark a sharper turn toward privacy, on a different scale than anything we've done in the past,\" Stretch said.\"Going forward,\" Stretch added, \"our approach to privacy controls will parallel our approach to financial controls, with a rigorous design process and individual certifications intended to ensure that our controls are working — and that we find and fix them when they are not.\"Under the agreement, Facebook affirms that it will weigh privacy considerations with every new product that it builds. It also agrees to produce quarterly compliance reports and add an independent board committee to oversee its privacy practices.But that doesn't go nearly far enough, according to Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy counsel at the digital rights group Public Knowledge.\"Under this settlement, Facebook does not have to meaningfully change how it collects and uses your data. Facebook retains complete control over when to share your data outside of Facebook, as long as the company complies with the privacy policy that it gets to write,\" Slaiman said.The agreement does nothing to address the competitive advantages that Facebook enjoys by virtue of its size and reach, and could even insulate the company from further enforcement actions, she argues.\"While the settlement does require additional auditing processes and reporting requirements as well as a very large fine, the settlement is weak given the repeated violations and the severity of the harm,\" Slaiman said. \"We must pass new and more effective privacy laws, as well as broader platform regulation aimed at improving competition in the sector so that consumers can more easily switch to an alternative product if they are not happy.\"The $5 billion penalty is far and away the largest the FTC has collected in such a case, but plenty of observers have pointed out that Facebook is a very rich company that can well afford to pay the fee.Not all of the criticisms of the settlement came from consumer advocates who wanted the company to face tougher penalties.At TechFreedom, a think tank with a libertarian bent, president Berin Szoka observed that $5 billion is no small penalty, even for Facebook, but while the company can rather easily afford it, \"who else could?\"\"Nothing could do more to discourage competition with today's tech giants than the looming threat of such massive fines,\" Szoka said. \"Those cheering today's settlement as a victory against Big Tech should think twice about its long-term effects on those trying to dethrone Facebook.\"Kenneth Corbin has been covering public policy as a working journalist for more than a decade, filing dispatches from Washington, New York, New Orleans, Baltimore and Bo...\n"

      "<title>Why Won't Facebook Create 'Safe Spaces' From Political Ads?</title>\n",
      "Getty ImagesSilicon Valley has been a leading proponent of the idea of so-called “safe spaces” in colleges and businesses in which dedicated rooms are established where students and employees can go to get away from viewpoints, information and mentions that distress them or triggers past trauma. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, news relating to the new administration and its policies were a common refrain in the call for more safe spaces. At the same time, Silicon Valley’s social media platforms saturate those same vulnerable individuals with ceaseless political ads that are impossible to escape. Why don’t platforms like Facebook allow users to opt-out of political advertisements, creating digital safe spaces from content that triggers them?In our ever more hyper-partisan world in which differing viewpoints and information that conflicts with one’s viewpoints and beliefs or which touches upon past traumatic experiences can lead to intense psychological trauma, so-called “safe spaces” have emerged in the academic and corporate world as a way to escape the traumas of the real world.Despite their growing popularity, these physical rooms have no counterpart in the digital world.Attempting to insulate oneself online from contrary viewpoints or information or from narratives that touch upon past traumatic experiences is next to impossible. By their very design social media platforms are constructed to flood their users with an endless stream of information that is algorithmically curated just for them, personalized to maximize their reaction. Given that outrage provokes a far more energetic (and thus monetizable) response than serenity, the more social media platforms learn about us, the more they surround us with an endless curated firehose of hate and horror that is personalized just for us.\n",
      "Broadcast platforms like Twitter make it difficult to escape such content, since anyone can reach anyone else, yet even closed social networks like Facebook, in which connections are reciprocal, pose a growing challenge through their advertising.On Facebook a user can carefully construct their social group to ensure it consists only of those who think and act exactly like themselves, creating a homogeneous echo chamber that entirely insulates them from the outside world.Unfortunately, this echo chamber cannot protect them from advertisements.Facebook’s advertising preferences today allow users only to opt out of alcohol, parenting and pet-related ads. The idea of permitting users to opt out of categories which can be triggering to them is a relatively new concept at Facebook, introduced just two years ago, yet is limited to just these three topics.Notably absent from this list are political advertisements. Political and issue advertisements frequently touch upon the rawest and most divisive societal fracture lines that are often what drive individuals to seek refuge within those physical safe spaces. An ad for a brand of soda or bath towels at the local supermarket are unlikely to trigger trauma in the average person. Political ads, by their very nature, are designed to prompt strong emotional responses along the fault lines that define the partisan world of politics.Getting away from these ads can be nearly impossible. Today’s ads are so hyper-targeted and run in such vast quantities that no amount of clicking “don’t show me this ad” can stop the deluge, especially around election time.A user who is triggered by any mention of a particular political candidate who is running for election in their district will find it effectively impossible to escape their barrage of campaign ads on Facebook. Every login will bring another stream of ads and the more that user attempts to avoid them, the more they are likely to see.Even using Facebook’s advertising settings to manually remove every conceivable advertising selector and request that their interests not be used to show them ads will still likely end up being saturated by campaign ads. They are simply impossible to escape in today’s digital-first campaigning.For a company like Facebook that has embraced the concept of safe spaces in the physical world, why does it not offer the digital equivalent on its platform, allowing its users to get away from political advertisements that cause them enormous emotional distress?A company spokesperson confirmed the company’s commitment to safe spaces and noted that it offers meditation spaces and special rooms for its own employees as a form of “safe space” and that for employees that feel triggered at work, many are permitted to work from home to escape those triggers. The spokesperson also noted that the company has rolled out new policies this year governing its internal message boards and communications forums in an effort to make all employees comfortable.Yet when asked why the company does not extend the same courtesy to offer the digital equivalent of such safe spaces to its two billion users to escape from advertisements that cause them deep distress or trauma and may even trigger hospitalization, the spokesperson said the company did not have comment.Asked why the company does not at the very least allow users to request that political ads be displayed with a blurred overlay with a trigger warning that requires manually clicking to see the actual ad, the company again declined to comment.This raises the question of why the company apparently does not believe that “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings” are a useful or important tool in today’s world for its users, despite extending such protections to its own employees. After all, if Facebook believed safe spaces were so important, it would roll them out on its own site by allowing users to protect themselves from triggering advertising content. Once again, the company declined to comment.Asked whether the company believes it should be held legally, ethically or morally responsible if a user suffers emotional distress or hospitalization from encountering an advertisement that triggers them given that the company actively refuses to allow users to remove political advertisements from their Facebook experience, the company again declined to comment.Given that Facebook does actively screen advertisements to ensure that they comply with its terms of service, it is not a neutral platform. It has a set of content standards and actively enforces these through moderation. This raises the question of how it would respond to the criticism that if it is actively enforcing content standards on its platform, it has a moral responsibility to provide a safe space on its platform that protects users from allowable content that triggers them. Again, the company declined to comment.Of course, one could argue that the point of advertising is to allow users to be forcibly exposed to views and perspectives they might not otherwise consume. At the same time, there must be a balance between forcible exposure to unexpected content and forced exposure to unwanted content that causes immense distress.On possibility would be to allow users to select the specific issues, political parties and candidates they would like to hear from, isolating them from issues and candidates that trigger them. Asked whether the company would consider offering such options, the company again declined to comment.Of course, the reason behind Facebook’s refusal to allow political ads to be filtered comes down to simple economics: those ads bring in huge revenue.Putting this all together, despite endorsing the concept of safe spaces and providing them to its own employees, Facebook appears to have little interest in offering a digital equivalent to its two billion users that would allow them to shield themselves from the increasingly divisive political and issue ads that can cause them immense trauma and distress.The company’s refusal to comment on any of these issues reminds us that for all its public statements, it has little interest in meaningful change that would impact its bottom line.In the end, as long as political ads bring in revenue, it will be impossible to escape them.Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years...\n"

      "<title>Facebook Takes Action As Terrorists Found Using Platform To Recruit And Campaign</title>\n",
      "\"When terrorists misuse the internet,\" Facebook explained in a blog post on Wednesday, July 24, \"they often upload the same piece of content to multiple platforms to maximize their reach.\" This has allowed the social media giant—along with Google, Microsoft and Twitter under the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) alliance—to \"more quickly identify and take action against potential terrorist content on our respective platforms.\"In 2018, the alliance reached its intended milestone of assembling 100,000 such hashes. In the first half of 2019, though, the number has already doubled. There are now \"more than 200,000 unique hashes in the database,\" each of which is described as a digital fingerprint pointing to a known piece of terrorist content.The scale speaks for itself, as does news from the frontline.Israel's internal security agency Shin Bet accused Iran this week of sponsoring a social media campaign to recruit individuals in Israel \"for the benefit of Iranian intelligence.\" According to reports, the would-be recruits were asked to gather information on the ground to help prepare terrorist attacks. Such targets included military and civilian locations. In a statement (also on Wednesday, July 24), Shin Bet said \"the vast majority of Israeli citizens refused to cooperate, because they suspected it was a hostile element and cut off contact with them—security forces will continue to act with determination to thwart any activity by Iran and terrorist elements acting on its behalf against the security of the state.\"\n",
      "Shin Bet claimed the Iranian-backed campaign was orchestrated from Syria, under the guise of an individual known as Abu-Jihad, who used fake Facebook profiles and sought to entice target individuals onto messaging applications. There had already been arrests in Israel in recent months following the use of social media to recruit on behalf of Hezbollah and Hamas. \"Using social networks,\" Shin Bet said in a statement following this latest counter-terrorist operation, \"is a method known to intelligence agencies as being used by terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Hezbollah, to recruit activists.\" The same day, Wednesday, July 24, a court in Abu Dhabi sentenced a Filipino man to 10 years imprisonment for \"promoting the ideology of terrorist organizations\" through social media channels—primarily Facebook. According to local media, the charges included \"setting up and running accounts on social media, including a Twitter account called 'Abu Zubair', five accounts on Facebook with different names and a seventh account on Telegram—all urging young people to join terrorist groups and to provide financial support to their members and affiliates around the world.\"Although all the major social media platforms have come under increasing pressure in recent months for their inability to curtail content and engagement that promotes illegal terrorist activity, Facebook finds itself the leader of the pack. It is a role that has always been there, given its scale, reach and levels of engagement, but it reached new levels of public scrutiny after the attacks earlier this year in Christchurch.At the G20 summit in Osaka last month, a statement was proposed by Australia and signed by all member-states, \"urging online platforms to meet our citizens’ expectations that they must not allow the use of their platforms to facilitate terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism.\"Unsurprisingly, Facebook was quick to welcome statement, with a spokesperson saying at the time that \"we’ve been reviewing what more we can do to limit our services from being used to cause harm or spread hate.\"Back in March, Facebook was heavily criticized after two consecutive mosque attacks in Christchurch in which 51 people were killed, were live-streamed, highlighting the inadequacies of the company's systems. It became clear that the company needed users to alert to a real-time incident, and none did. And as newer systems were put in place to use AI to determine harmful content, the need for volumes of specific training data became clear—Facebook acknowledged at the time that there simply had not been enough such data to make the system work.Two months later, in May, Facebook joined other representatives from Big Tech at a meeting in Paris, hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, which launched the \"Christchurch Call to Action,\" which set out to prevent repeats, to stop the dissemination of terrorist content on social media.Now, in addition to updating on the scale of content on its hash-based blacklist, Facebook has also announced joint protocols which will enable Big Tech to respond to crises like Christchurch—to enable and empower companies to more quickly and effectively respond to emerging and active events.\" In essence, shifting the incident response balance from individual companies to a collective in the hope that it casts a wider net more quickly. \"The protocol,\" Facebook explained, \"can be triggered by a real-world event involving murder or attempted murder of defenseless civilians or innocents—we will work together to categorize the type of incident and the anticipated level and degree of online impact.\"The news from the Middle East relates more to the use of social media as an engagement and messaging platform than for content distribution, but it is all clearly linked. Threads pulled will link to individuals and networks of individuals. Scraping social media, both at home and in overseas locations, has become commonplace in intelligence gathering operations. The same platforms have also become a hotbed for recruitment and compromise—targeting military personnel on social media was one of the topics raised in the recent cyber escalation between the U.S. and Iran. There is clearly a physical element to nation-state offensive cyber capabilities that usually has local individuals somewhere in the chain.So, a week of unrelated social media news linked to ongoing terrorist activities and propaganda—but, clearly, it's not unrelated at all. While there is a public interest in cleaning harmful content from the platforms we use each day, there remains a greater public interest in denying terrorist organizations access to the platforms they use to facilitate their campaigns. And, of course, to use those same platforms to identify the terrorists and their networks, to stop them, and to bring them to justice.I am the Founder/CEO of Digital Barriers,  developing disruptive edge-AI video surveillance and analytics  for defense, security and  commercial organizations in the US...I am the Founder/CEO of Digital Barriers,  developing disruptive edge-AI video surveillance and analytics  for defense, security and  commercial organizations in the US\n",
      "<title>Facebook Sales Jump; Profit Hit By Expenses From $5 Billion FTC Fine</title>\n",
      "Facebook shares continue to rise despite a record-setting $5 billion fine issued against the social media giant by U.S. regulators. (Photo by LOIC VENANCE/AFP/Getty Images)Facebook proved again its advertising engine can weather public backlash, reporting a surge in sales on the back of increased engagement and users, who now top 2.4 billion. The Menlo Park, California-based company [FB] reported $16.9 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up 28% year-over-year, beating revenue forecasts of $16.5 billion compiled by Refinitiv. The company also reported profit fell 49% to $2.6 billion, hit by a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission as the result of a yearlong investigation prompted by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company said it recorded a $2 billion charge related to legal costs this quarter as a result. Excluding that and an additional $1.1 billion income tax expense, earnings per share would have been $1.99 per share, beating analyst expectations of $1.88 per share.Facebook shares rose more than 1% after hours, extending a 50% rise year-to-date as investors have looked beyond the expected regulatory penalty to continued user and sales growth. But data-privacy and antitrust legislation loom large for Facebook and could affect how the company collects and ultimately monetizes personal information of its users.It acknowledged at least some of this regulatory activity in the earnings report. Buried in the footnotes of the earnings release was a two-line admission that Facebook is now the target of two separate antitrust probes: “In June 2019, we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. In addition, in July 2019, the Department of Justice announced that it will begin an antitrust review of market-leading online platforms.”Facebook executives have responded to a storm of inquiries from U.S. regulators through most of this year. In addition to today’s resolution of a 16-month FTC investigation, Facebook’s cryptocurrency chief David Marcus appeared in front of House and Senate committees last week to answer questions about the company’s digital currency Libra. Still, users—and advertisers — keep coming. It reported 1.59 billion daily active users on average for June, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Facebook’s monthly active users also increased by 8% year-over-year. On the earnings call, CFO David Wehner said he expects revenue to slow heading into 2020 as the company deals with various regulatory headwinds and product changes. Zuckerberg on the same call took a much longer view on the obstacles ahead, saying that it was important to let all of the company’s products “mature.” “After helping people connect with friends and family, helping people connect with communities is the next most important social problem that we believe we can help address [on Facebook], and that’s just going to be an area of increasing value in the product,” said Zuckerberg. Not everyone expects regulation to have a significant impact on business, though. Democratic FTC commissioner Rohit Chopra said in his dissenting statement against the $5 billion order: “The settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to these violations. Nor does it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics.”I'm an associate editor at Forbes covering Facebook and social media.

      "<title>Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes is now lobbying to break up the social media giant - The Washington Post</title>\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has become one of the company’s biggest problems.In recent weeks, Hughes, who left the social media giant in 2007 and cashed out his nearly $500 million worth of stock, has been making the rounds in the nation’s capital, visiting a dozen lawmakers and regulators at the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies interested in examining whether Facebook has amassed too much power. He’s talked with the staff of the New York attorney general.In some of those meetings, he and his collaborators have presented a 39-page slide deck that makes a point-by-point legal case for breaking up the social network, drawing on decades of antitrust law precedent.The crux of the case, designed by two antitrust scholars: Facebook’s wealth and power and massive user base have pushed it into monopoly territory, and its acquisitions of rivals have squashed competition. More than 2.7 billion people use Facebook or its other platforms, which include Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp, at least once a month, Facebook said Wednesday.[Justice Department announces broad antitrust review of big tech]“I hope that my speaking out provides cover to a lot of other folks, whether former employees or current ones, to express ambivalence or concern about what’s going on,” Hughes said in an interview Thursday. “And I think there’s a lot to be concerned about.”Hughes, who helped develop the social media giant with Mark Zuckerberg in their Harvard University dorm, has become a critical weapon to trust-busters in a fight that keeps expanding in scope, threatening tech giants including Amazon, Apple and Google with potential new regulations or even a breakup. Just this week, the Justice Department said it was opening an expanded inquiry targeting “market-leading online platforms.” And on Wednesday, Facebook disclosed that it is facing an antitrust investigation by the FTC.Hughes has become one of the most powerful in a new breed of antagonists to Facebook: a former executive who believes he created something that is now harmful to society.Facebook declined to comment. Some of Hughes’s lobbying was first reported by the New York Times.The growing momentum in Washington to more closely scrutinize the role of tech giants in consumers’ lives and the effect on competition — one of the few bipartisan issues emerging among lawmakers and candidates across the nation — has often been fueled by private complaints by small businesses and rivals that feel as though they’ve gotten a raw deal as the massive companies dominate their relative spaces.Hughes is joined in public criticism of Facebook by former Facebook president Sean Parker, early investor Roger McNamee and other former senior executives.Facebook has argued that it is not a monopoly and should not be broken up. Testifying before Congress in April 2018, Zuckerberg responded to a question about the competition his company faces by pointing out that the average American uses eight apps to communicate with friends. “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” Zuckerberg said when Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) asked whether Facebook is a monopoly.[U.S. government issues stunning rebuke, historic $5 billion fine against Facebook for repeated privacy violations]Hughes started his campaign publicly. After leaving Facebook to volunteer for Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, he worked for years in politics and nonprofit organizations, plus a four-year stint as owner of the New Republic. In 2016, he helped found a think tank focused on inequality, the subject of a book he wrote last year. The research prompted questions regarding the dangers of the concentration of corporate power.“I had a very personal realization that I cannot speak to anything that has to do with antimonopoly work without wrestling with my own past,” he said. “The huge monopoly power is why I have the financial resources that I have.”Hughes wrote a widely read New York Times op-ed published in May that argued that the company he helped found should be broken up.The decision to publicly oppose Facebook in the op-ed was a difficult one, he said.“I knew I would lose some friends over it. And that’s okay because some things are that important,” he said. “But it’s been nice on the other side of it, too, to have the argument out there, to speak my mind about what I think and believe.”Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president for global affairs and communications, responded to the op-ed by writing his own several days later arguing that Facebook should not be dismantled. “What matters is not our size but rather the rights and interests of consumers, and our accountability to the governments and legislators who oversee commerce and communications.”[For Facebook’s Zuckerberg, FTC settlement could bring a new era of accountability]Soon after, Hughes was contacted by two prominent antitrust scholars, Scott Hemphill of New York University School of Law and Tim Wu of Columbia Law School. The two academics and longtime collaborators had been developing an argument for breaking up Facebook in the form of the slide presentation. To them, the purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp represented a “plain-vanilla violation of antitrust law, just low-hanging fruit,” Wu said in an interview. They began to pitch lawmakers and regulators together.Academics and lawmakers who have worked with Hughes say he has helped explain the motivations and viewpoints of key players at Facebook, including Zuckerberg — although Hughes says he has no specific insider knowledge. They say Hughes can frame the business practices of present-day Silicon Valley in ways that jibe with largely untested antitrust laws that were written for major oil and rail companies decades ago.After House lawmakers embarked on their broad antitrust investigation of Facebook and its fellow tech giants in June, one of the first people they consulted was Hughes, said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust law. Hughes quietly paid a visit to members of the House’s top competition-focused panel earlier this month, meeting with lawmakers and their staff members to pitch many of the issues he raised in his op-ed.Hughes presented his views as a former Facebook insider, something that lent credence to his arguments, Cicilline said. \"It’s remarkable and significant to me and my colleagues that someone with such a role in creating the company has the capacity and courage, really, to say, 'We have some challenges, some things to look at.’ ”The case Hughes and academics lay out in their presentation centers on the Sherman Act, the government’s primary law for investigating and penalizing anticompetitive practices. Congress adopted the law in 1890 at a time of rapid consolidation in the United States that created oil and railroad giants the government later challenged as monopolies.The law and its later updates prohibit acquiring another company with the main purpose of getting rid of a potential or actual competitor.[Facebook, Google and other tech giants to face antitrust investigation by House lawmakers]Facebook was doing just that when it acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, the team argues. While Instagram was still tiny, Zuckerberg identified its explosive growth on mobile phones as the obvious antidote to Facebook’s largely desktop product. Mobile was considered a clear weakness for Facebook as the company headed into its initial public offering in 2012.Hughes’s feedback shaped the scholars’ case, as he helped them understand how executives in Silicon Valley think about competition — it tends to be measured by viral growth rather than by size, said Hemphill, the New York University professor. At the time, the two professors were working on a roadshow, which they asked Hughes to join.While Instagram was small, it was growing rapidly. “That must have been terrifying” for Facebook, Hemphill said. “It helps bring home the threat, the observability of the threat and the intensity of it.”Motivation can be the determining factor when it comes to successfully bringing an antitrust case against a giant corporation, Hemphill said. For example, a 1995 memo from Bill Gates, then the chief executive of Microsoft, suggesting that rival Netscape was leading in an “Internet Tidal Wave” became a smoking gun in a case that suggested why the company was protecting its operating system.Hughes, Hemphill and Wu also flag Facebook’s enormous balance sheet and user base, something that impressed House lawmakers when Hughes presented to them this month.“The thing that stuck with me . . . was he focused on Facebook’s revenue as a true measure of its role in the marketplace,” Cicilline recalled. “Facebook captures over 80 percent of all global social media revenue and controls 58 percent of the U.S. social media market. That’s significant.”Across the Capitol, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) sought out Hughes for a meeting earlier this month to talk privacy and competition. She recently created a special “task force” to study those issues and potentially endorse legislative solutions in the coming months.Blackburn has pitched legislation for years that would limit how tech giants collect and monetize users' data, a bill that Facebook long has opposed through its lobbying organizations. But she said Hughes was \"very familiar\" with it, and during her meeting, encouraged Blackburn in her efforts generally to \"begin to put some guidelines and some guardrails in place.\"Lawmakers and regulators have also held meetings with other antitrust experts, according to those leaders, such as Barry Lynn from the Open Markets Institute, and Gene Kimmelman, a former top Justice Department antitrust official who until recently ran Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy group that has lobbied for stronger competition enforcement against tech and telecom consolidation.Hughes spoke to Public Knowledge in June after meeting Kimmelman at an event.“I think he’s extremely interested in this as part of his broader philosophy,” Kimmelman said. “He’s very concerned with the concentration of wealth and power in society.”Hughes has been donating to various 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and said he likes some of those who have been most outspoken regarding both breaking up big tech and promoting the middle class.Regarding the increased regulatory scrutiny of big tech, he said developments have happened more quickly than he expected. “The $5 billion FTC fine, which I think Facebook and many others expected to be the end of the story, it seems like it’s not going to be. It seems like it was the closing of one chapter and the opening of another,\" he added.Hughes said that he has not heard from his longtime friend and co-founder Zuckerberg since publishing the op-ed.Correction: Roger McNamee was an early investor in Facebook.

      "<title>Facebook’s News Feed ads are changing - Digiday</title>\n",
      "Facebook will soon tweak the creative restrictions to ads in its mobile News Feed. The changes will shrink the amount of text and the image size, which marketers say should improve ad copy overall but would be burdensome.Facebook ads placed in mobile will only show three lines of text, compared to the seven that could previously be viewed. Facebook users can click to show more. Photos and videos will have a 4:5 aspect ratio, at most, compared to the previous 2:3. These upcoming changes were first revealed by Susan Wenograd, vp of marketing strategy at agency Aimclear, and confirmed by digital marketer David Herrmann. The new restrictions will start to be applied Aug. 19, Wenograd said.These moves come as Facebook ads become more expensive, especially in the News Feed, and more advertisers join Facebook. The company recently touted its new milestone of supporting 7 million active advertisers. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg stressed at Cannes that the success of the company is based on growing its small business accounts, not just ad dollars from big brands. The hope for these changes is that all advertisers will be forced to make more engaging Facebook ads, marketers said.“Copy is now more vital, not the afterthought for once,” Herrmann said.Jack Appleby, director of creative strategy at agency Midnight Oil, said he also is interested to watch how Facebook advertising handles the “significantly” shorter copy length.“The standard pithy one-liner plus feature-approach plus [call-to-action] won’t comfortably fit in three lines. Social copywriters will have to make a prioritization choice. I bet [direct-to-consumer] brands will double-down on feature marketing, while bigger brands will stick with feel-good copy down the lifestyle line,” Appleby said.Andrea Cruz, digital marketing manager at Boston-based Ko Marketing, said it will be interesting to evaluate if one paragraph, bullets or one sentence performs best in the News Feed.Wenograd said she wasn’t bothered by the truncation of copy text and was curious to see if users would be likely to click and expand the text. It’s unclear if clicking on the text will be tracked within the “Clicks (All)” total on Facebook advertisers’ dashboard and, therefore, if advertisers can then remarket to the users based on that action. Post engagement currently includes reacting to, commenting on or sharing the ad along with viewing a photo or video or clicking on a link.Subscribe for an exclusive, inside look at what’s actually happening in the video industry delivered to your inbox weekly.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The changing of image size will be more of a burden on any Facebook advertiser, especially those with a large number of different ads running. The creative will be automatically cropped to the new 4:5 aspect ratio.“On a typical image, this doesn’t seem like a huge thing because most images have the focal point toward the middle anyhow. What might start to seem less than optimal are the videos where brands use the black bars on the top and bottom to put text and [call-to-action] because now it’s being compressed into a smaller space,” Wenograd said.A frustration of other marketers is that they were not made aware of these changes until they were shown Wenograd’s tweet thread. Cruz said she wasn’t concerned with the burden of adhering to the changes, but that marketers like herself would have to review what they are currently running and what’s already in the design.“Another big issue is Facebook’s lack of transparency,” Cruz said. “At least to my knowledge there’s not an official statement yet.”Join Digiday+ and get Digiday magazine with your membership.Get Digiday's top stories every morning in your email inbox.Follow @Digiday for the latest news, insider access to events and more.\n",
      "<title>Facebook settles with FTC: $5 billion and new privacy guarantees – TechCrunch</title>\n",
      "Following more than a year of speculation since the Federal Trade Commission said it was investigating Facebook  over privacy lapses, the regulator has officially announced the terms of its settlement with the beleaguered social network: $5 billion (as previously rumored) and improved privacy oversight within the company.The order-mandated privacy program covers Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Facebook’s eponymous social platform.Facebook assessed $5 billion penalty, subjected to sweeping new restrictions on user privacy decisions to settle FTC  charges the company violated a 2012 FTC order by deceiving users about their ability to control privacy of their personal info. Read more: https://t.co/NYx2JnKmJV pic.twitter.com/7KVd3Vg02J— FTC (@FTC) July 24, 2019The order was approved in a 3-2 vote by the agency’s commissioners. The FTC notes that the penalty against Facebook is the largest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers’ privacy — as well as flagging that it’s “almost 20 times greater than the largest privacy or data security penalty ever imposed worldwide”.In addition to the money, Facebook will have to create a board committee on privacy, and must provide executive assurance that user data is being respected.“The settlement order announced today also imposes unprecedented new restrictions on Facebook’s business operations and creates multiple channels of compliance. The order requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight,” the FTC writes in a press release announcing the decision.“Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC chairman, Joe Simons, in a statement. “The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC. The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations. The Commission takes consumer privacy seriously, and will enforce FTC orders to the fullest extent of the law.”The FTC says the structure of its 20-year order against Facebook removes the “unfettered control” over privacy decisions exercised by CEO Mark Zuckerberg — by creating greater accountability at the board of directors level via the establishment of what it calls an “independent privacy committee”.“Members of the privacy committee must be independent and will be appointed by an independent nominating committee,” it writes. “Members can only be fired by a supermajority of the Facebook board of directors.”Facebook will also be required to designate compliance officers who will be responsible for Facebook’s privacy program.“These compliance officers will be subject to the approval of the new board privacy committee and can be removed only by that committee — not by Facebook’s CEO or Facebook employees,” it writes. “Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and designated compliance officers must independently submit to the FTC quarterly certifications that the company is in compliance with the privacy program mandated by the order, as well as an annual certification that the company is in overall compliance with the order. Any false certification will subject them to individual civil and criminal penalties.”Another strand is aimed at strengthening external oversight of Facebook, with the FTC claiming enhancements to audit processes which must take place every two years to evaluate the effectiveness of Facebook’s privacy program and identify any gaps.“The assessor’s biennial assessments of Facebook’s privacy program must be based on the assessor’s independent fact-gathering, sampling, and testing, and must not rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Facebook management,” it writes in what sounds like the end of Facebook being able to mark its own regulatory homework on its home turf.It goes on: “The order prohibits the company from making any misrepresentations to the assessor, who can be approved or removed by the FTC. Importantly, the independent assessor will be required to report directly to the new privacy board committee on a quarterly basis. The order also authorizes the FTC to use the discovery tools provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to monitor Facebook’s compliance with the order.”Facebook must also conduct a privacy review of every new or modified product, service, or practice before it is implemented, and document its decisions about user privacy, per the order.While the designated compliance officers must submit a quarterly privacy review report — sharing this with Facebook’s CEO and the independent assessor, as well as with the FTC upon its request.The order also imposes security breach disclosure requirements on Facebook, which is required to document incidents when data of 500 or more users has been compromised, along with details of how it has sought to fix the problem — and provide that to the FTC and the assessor within 30 days of discovering the breach.The FTC first confirmed that it was investigating Facebook in March of last year, during the then-new hubbub surrounding Cambridge Analytica’s abuse of data siphoned from the network. The regulator was specifically concerned that Facebook had been systematically violating the terms of its 2012 agreement, which barred them from a number of practices concerning user data.Rumors started less than a year later that the fine the FTC was considering would be “record-setting,” though as many pointed out at the time, almost any conceivable amount would be easily (if not gladly) written off by the company, which brings in upwards of $50 billion per year in revenue.Facebook fears no FTC fineIn April, seeing the writing on the wall and perhaps privy to some of the conversations, Facebook set aside $3 billion to cover the costs of the settlement it knew was coming (it still made a $2.4B profit), but said it expected the number may actually be $5 billion. And indeed that is the number that surfaced two weeks ago in early reports of the FTC vote. (Some had suggested fines far higher, perhaps mitigated by good behavior, but the FTC doesn’t seem to have taken them up on the idea.)While multi-billion dollar fines make splashy headlines there could well be far greater business costs (and product friction) for Facebook locked up in the administrative and bureaucratic requirements of the order.The FTC notes a laundry list of what it couches as “significant new privacy requirements” that it’s also imposing on the company — writing that:Although there are already criticisms of the order for not being strong enough — including from inside the FTC itself.Rohit Chopra, one of the commissioners who voted against the settlement, has published a statement explaining why he did not back it — in which he warns that it “doesn’t fix the incentives causing these repeat privacy abuses” because it fails to stop Facebook from “engaging in surveillance or integrating platforms”. “There are no restrictions on data harvesting tactics — just paperwork. $FB gets to sign off on what’s acceptable,” he wrote in a set of tweets summarizing his views after the settlement was announced. Chopra also objects to the lack of penalties for Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and other Facebook executives — pointing out that the FTC is going after individuals attached to Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of Facebook data yet letting Facebook’s leadership “get blanket immunity for their role in the violation”.He also flags that “settlement fine print gives Facebook broad immunity for ‘known’ and ‘unknown’ violations” — wondering: “What’s covered by these immunity deals? Facebook knows but the public is kept in the dark.”“Facebook’s flagrant violations were a direct result of their business model of mass surveillance and manipulation, and this action blesses this model. The settlement does not fix this problem. It now goes to court for approval,” he adds. “We should all be concerned that the business incentives of big tech platform behavioral advertising spur practices that are dividing our society. When companies break the law and cause massive harm, they need to be held accountable.”Also dissenting from the settlement is FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter who also takes the view the order will not do enough to “effectively deter Facebook from engaging in future law violations” — writing in her own dissenting statement that she would have preferred the agency to instigate litigation against Facebook and Zuckerberg, and fight for “the right outcome in a public court of law”.“I cannot view the order as adequately deterrent without both meaningful limitations on how Facebook collects, uses, and shares data and public transparency regarding Facebook’s data use and order compliance,” she also says, adding that her “deepest concern” is that “its release of Facebook and its officers from legal liability is far too broad”.Discussing the settlement in a phone call with TechCrunch, the FTC’s former CTO, Ashkan Soltani, dubbed it a “terrible outcome” for his former employer. “Facebook’s dominated the press schedule the entire time,” he told us. “They’ve controlled when this release is, same day as the Mueller [testimony], same day as their earnings’ call. The $5BN number — while significant for the agency is essentially a ‘get out of jail’ card for Facebook,” he added, noting that the order indemnifies for any behavior prior to June 12 — “which is I think unheard of”.“It’s kind of crazy in terms of how good of a deal this was for the company.”That such a favorable result could be signed off by even three of five commissioners is “a sign of who the FTC is”, he also said.“The significance of this case shows how limited the agency’s ability is,” he suggested. “They have limited authority but the settlement — this is unheard of. I’ve never seen a provision like that in another FTC order.”“I think it makes sense in terms of they were between a rock and a hard place in terms of what they could do,” he added. “The alternative would be to go to court against one of the largest companies in the world, with an endless budget, and the [enforcement] authority is kind of thin.”In terms of whether there’s anything of substance in the order that could rein in Facebook’s future behavior, Soltani suggested there are some “useful” injunctions which imply the agency looked at behavior beyond the Cambridge Analytica scandal.But at the same time there’s not enough here to respond to “where the company is going”.“I don’t think it really addresses the direction that Facebook is moving towards and it really highlights the lack of authority that the agency has,” he told us, discussing the limits of US protection for privacy in the age of data-mining tech giants.“The FTC is the trade Commission, right,” he added. “It’s designed to essentially protect against unfair and deceptive practices and it’s really designed to protect industry from one another… and somehow that evolved to be our leading consumer protection agency — but that authority is quite limited, particularly in the area of privacy.”David Carroll, the academic whose complaint against Cambridge Analytica’s use of his data features as a focal point of The Great Hack — the just released Netflix documentary that digs into the Facebook data abuse scandal — was also withering in his assessment of the FTC order.“Maybe a Netflix doc could be more punitive to Facebook than this settlement,” he told us.Facebook has responded to the penalty announcement in a lengthy blog post penned by general counsel, Colin Stretch. “The agreement will require a fundamental shift in the way we approach our work and it will place additional responsibility on people building our products at every level of the company,” he writes. “It will mark a sharper turn toward privacy, on a different scale than anything we’ve done in the past.“The accountability required by this agreement surpasses current US law and we hope will be a model for the industry. It introduces more stringent processes to identify privacy risks, more documentation of those risks, and more sweeping measures to ensure that we meet these new requirements. Going forward, our approach to privacy controls will parallel our approach to financial controls, with a rigorous design process and individual certifications intended to ensure that our controls are working — and that we find and fix them when they are not.”Stretch goes on to describe the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal as “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who depend on us to protect their data”, before claiming the company will adopt a new more “robust” approach to privacy risk.“We will be more robust in ensuring that we identify, assess and mitigate privacy risk,” he writes. “We will adopt new approaches to more thoroughly document the decisions we make and monitor their impact. And we will introduce more technical controls to better automate privacy safeguards.”He also says Facebook will undertake a review of its “systems” — which he says the company expects will surface “issues” — pledging that “when it does, we will work swiftly to address them”.Buried later on in the blog, Stretch also confirms that Facebook has settled a separate investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission — agreeing to pay a further $100M to resolve a probe of its processes for disclosing data abuses to investors.“We share the SEC’s interest in ensuring that we are transparent with our investors about the material risks we face, and we have already updated our disclosures and controls in this area,” he writes.In another response, Zuckerberg has posted a comment about the settlement on his Facebook page — where he says “we’re going to make some major structural changes to how we build products and run this company”.He also writes that Facebook expects complying with the changes instigated by the FTC order will take “hundreds of engineers and more than a thousand people across our company”.Although it’s not clear whether that means Facebook will be beefing up its headcount, with 1,000 extra hires, or shifting priorities of what some of its existing staff focus on.This report was updated with additional comment\n"

      "<title>Facebook AI Creates Its Own Language In Creepy Preview Of Our Potential Future</title>\n",
      "British scientist Stephen Hawking warned about the potentially tragic consequences of artificial intelligence in 2014. / AFP / NIKLAS HALLE'N (Photo credit should read NIKLAS HALLE'N/AFP/Getty Images)Facebook shut down an artificial intelligence engine after developers discovered that the AI had created its own unique language that humans can’t understand. Researchers at the Facebook AI Research Lab (FAIR) found that the chatbots had deviated from the script and were communicating in a new language developed without human input. It is as concerning as it is amazing – simultaneously a glimpse of both the awesome and horrifying potential of AI.Artificial Intelligence is not sentient—at least not yet. It may be someday, though – or it may approach something close enough to be dangerous. Ray Kurzweil warned years ago about the technological singularity. The Oxford dictionary defines “the singularity” as, “A hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence and other technologies have become so advanced that humanity undergoes a dramatic and irreversible change.”To be clear, we aren’t really talking about whether or not Alexa is eavesdropping on your conversations, or whether Siri knows too much about your calendar and location data. There is a massive difference between a voice-enabled digital assistant and an artificial intelligence. These digital assistant platforms are just glorified web search and basic voice interaction tools. The level of “intelligence” is minimal compared to a true machine learning artificial intelligence. Siri and Alexa can’t hold a candle to IBM’s Watson.\n",
      "Scientists and tech luminaries, including Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Wozniak have warned that AI could lead to tragic unforeseen consequences. Eminent physicist Stephen Hawking cautioned in 2014 that AI could mean the end of the human race. “It would take off on its own and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.”Why is this scary? Think SKYNET from Terminator, or WOPR from War Games. Our entire world is wired and connected. An artificial intelligence will eventually figure that out – and figure out how to collaborate and cooperate with other AI systems. Maybe the AI will determine that mankind is a threat, or that mankind is an inefficient waste of resources – conclusions that seems plausible from a purely logical perspective.Machine learning and artificial intelligence have phenomenal potential to simplify, accelerate, and improve many aspects of our lives. Computers can ingest and process massive quantities of data and extract patterns and useful information at a rate exponentially faster than humans, and that potential is being explored and developed around the world.I am not saying the sky is falling. I am not saying we need to pull the plug on all machine learning and artificial intelligence and return to a simpler, more Luddite existence. We do need to proceed with caution, though. We need to closely monitor and understand the self-perpetuating evolution of an artificial intelligence, and always maintain some means of disabling it or shutting it down. If the AI is communicating using a language that only the AI knows, we may not even be able to determine why or how it does what it does, and that might not work out well for mankind.I am Senior Manager of Content Marketing for Alert Logic and Editor-in-Chief of TechSpective.

      "<title>Facebook’s image outage reveals how the company’s AI tags your photos - The Verge</title>\n",
      "Filed under:‘Oh wow, the AI just tagged my profile picture as basic’Everyone knows the bit in The Matrix when Neo achieves digital messiah status and suddenly sees “reality” for what it really is: lines of trailing green code. Well, thanks to an outage currently affecting Facebook, users of the social network have been given a similar peek behind the digital curtain, with many images on the site now replaced with the tags they’ve been assigned by the company’s machine vision systems. So if you browse through your uploaded photos, instead of seeing holiday snaps or pictures of food and friends, you’ll be shown text saying things like “image may contain: people smiling, people dancing, wedding and indoor” or just “image may contain: cat.” In short: this is how your life looks to a computer. This is how Facebook’s AI is judging you. Do you feel ashamed before the all-seeing digital eye?!Oh yeah! I forgot Facebook uses machine learning to tag our photos with what it sees in the picture. To be fair, \"one person, beard\" is pretty much a spot-on description of me. pic.twitter.com/fCpydUxtpzThe same image tags are showing up on Instagram, and as well as detailing general scene and object descriptions, they also suggest who is in a photo based on Facebook’s facial recognition. (The company has been doing this for photos you’re not tagged in since 2017.)Facebook has been using machine learning to “read” images in this way since at least April 2016, and the project is a big part of the company’s accessibility efforts. Such tags are used to describe photos and videos to users with sight impairments. What’s not clear is whether Facebook also uses this information to target ads. There’s a lot of data about users’ lives that they might otherwise shield from Facebook contained in these images: whether you’ve got a pet, what your hobbies are, where you like going on holiday, or if you’re really into vintage cars, or swords, or whatever.Back in 2017, one programmer was motivated by these questions to make a Chrome extension that revealed these tags. As they wrote at the time: “I think a lot of internet users don’t realize the amount of information that is now routinely extracted from photographs.” Judging by the reactions on Twitter to this outage, this is certainly new information to a lot of people. We’ve reached out to Facebook to confirm whether they use this data for ad targeting and will update this story accordingly. One nice thing about Facebook being utterly borked right now is it gives you a chance to see what its (very nice!) accessibility feature auto-alting images does.https://t.co/a3w9PcOosR pic.twitter.com/dnTXOih8HpRegardless of how this information is being used, though, it’s a fascinating peek behind the scenes at one of the world’s biggest data gathering operations. It also shows to what degree the visual world has become machine readable. Improvements in deep learning in recent years have truly revolutionized the world of machine vision, and visual content online is often as legible to machines as text. But once something is legible, of course, it becomes easy to store, analyze, and extract data from. It’s only when the system breaks down, like today, that we realize it’s happening at all.FB's broken AI photo recognition tool left one person out.

      "<title data-rh=\"true\">Facebook’s A.I. Whiz Now Faces the Task of Cleaning It Up. Sometimes That Brings Him to Tears. - The New York Times</title>\n",
      "Facebook has heralded artificial intelligence as a solution to its toxic content problems. Mike Schroepfer, its chief technology officer, says it won’t solve everything.Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, is leading the social network’s efforts to build the automated tools to sort through and erase the millions of posts with toxic content.CreditCreditPeter Prato for The New York TimesSupported byBy Cade Metz and Mike IsaacMENLO PARK, Calif. — Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, was tearing up.For half an hour, we had been sitting in a conference room at Facebook’s headquarters, surrounded by whiteboards covered in blue and red marker, discussing the technical difficulties of removing toxic content from the social network. Then we brought up an episode where the challenges had proved insurmountable: the shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand.In March, a gunman had killed 51 people in two mosques there and live streamed it on Facebook. It took the company roughly an hour to remove the video from its site. By then, the bloody footage had spread across social media.Mr. Schroepfer went quiet. His eyes began to glisten.“We’re working on this right now,” he said after a minute, trying to remain composed. “It won’t be fixed tomorrow. But I do not want to have this conversation again six months from now. We can do a much, much better job of catching this.”The question is whether that is really true or if Facebook is kidding itself.For the past three years, the social network has been under scrutiny for the proliferation of false, misleading and inappropriate content that people publish on its site. In response, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has invoked a technology that he says will help eliminate the problematic posts: artificial intelligence.Before Congress last year, Mr. Zuckerberg testified that Facebook was developing machine-based systems to “identify certain classes of bad activity” and declared that “over a five- to 10-year period, we will have A.I. tools” that can detect and remove hate speech. He has since blithely repeated these claims with the media, on conference calls with Wall Street and at Facebook’s own events.Mr. Schroepfer — or Schrep, as he is known internally — is the person at Facebook leading the efforts to build the automated tools to sort through and erase the millions of such posts. But the task is Sisyphean, he acknowledged over the course of three interviews recently.That’s because every time Mr. Schroepfer and his more than 150 engineering specialists create A.I. solutions that flag and squelch noxious material, new and dubious posts that the A.I. systems have never seen before pop up — and are thus not caught. The task is made more difficult because “bad activity” is often in the eye of the beholder and humans, let alone machines, cannot agree on what that is.In one interview, Mr. Schroepfer acknowledged after some prodding that A.I. alone could not cure Facebook’s ills. “I do think there’s an endgame here,” he said. But “I don’t think it’s ‘everything’s solved,’ and we all pack up and go home.”The pressure is on, however. This past week, after widespread criticism over the Christchurch video, Facebook changed its policies to restrict the use of its live streaming service. At a summit in Paris with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand on Wednesday, the company also signed a pledge to re-examine the tools it uses to identify violent content.Mr. Schroepfer, 44, is in a position he never wanted to be in. For years, his job was to help the social network build a top-flight A.I. lab, where the brightest minds could tackle technological challenges like using machines to pick out people’s faces in photos. He and Mr. Zuckerberg wanted an A.I. operation to rival Google’s, which was widely seen as having the deepest stable of A.I. researchers. He recruited Ph.D.s from New York University, the University of London and the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris.But along the way, his role evolved into one of threat removal and toxic content eliminator. Now he and his recruits spend much of their time applying A.I. to spotting and deleting death threats, videos of suicides, misinformation and outright lies.“None of us have ever seen anything like this,” said John Lilly, a former chief executive of Mozilla and now a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners, who studied computer science with Mr. Schroepfer at Stanford University in the mid-1990s. “There is no one else to ask about how to solve these problems.”Facebook allowed us to talk to Mr. Schroepfer because it wanted to show how A.I. is catching troublesome content and, presumably, because it was interested in humanizing its executives. The chief technology officer often shows his feelings, according to many who know him.“I don’t think I’m speaking out of turn to say that I’ve seen Schrep cry at work,” said Jocelyn Goldfein, a venture capitalist at Zetta Venture Partners who worked with him at Facebook.But few could have predicted how Mr. Schroepfer would react to our questions. In two of the interviews, he started with an optimistic message that A.I. could be the solution, before becoming emotional. At one point, he said coming to work had sometimes become a struggle. Each time, he choked up when discussing the scale of the issues that Facebook was confronting and his responsibilities in changing them.“It’s never going to go to zero,” he said of the problematic posts.One Sunday in December 2013, Clément Farabet walked into the penthouse suite at the Harrah’s hotel and casino in Lake Tahoe, Nev. Inside, he was greeted by Mr. Schroepfer and Mr. Zuckerberg.Mr. Zuckerberg was shoeless. Over the next 30 minutes, the C.E.O. paced back and forth in his socks while keeping up a conversation with Dr. Farabet, an A.I. researcher at New York University. Mr. Zuckerberg described A.I. as “the next big thing” and “the next step for Facebook.” Mr. Schroepfer, seated on the couch, occasionally piped up to reinforce a point.They were in town to recruit A.I. talent. Lake Tahoe was the venue that year for NIPS, an academic conference dedicated to A.I. that attracts the world’s top researchers. The Facebook brass had brought along Yann LeCun, an N.Y.U. academic who is regarded as a founding father of the modern artificial intelligence movement, and whom they had just hired to build an A.I. lab. Dr. Farabet, who regards Dr. LeCun as a mentor, was also on their shortlist.“He basically wanted to hire everybody,” Dr. Farabet said of Mr. Zuckerberg. “He knew the names of every single researcher in the space.”Those were heady days for Facebook, before its trajectory turned and the mission of its A.I. work changed.At the time, Silicon Valley’s biggest tech companies — from Google to Twitter — were racing to become forces in A.I. The technology had been dismissed by the internet firms for years. But at universities, researchers like Dr. LeCun had quietly nurtured A.I. systems called “neural networks,” complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. To the surprise of many in Silicon Valley, these arcane and somewhat mysterious systems had finally started to work.Mr. Schroepfer and Mr. Zuckerberg wanted to push Facebook into that contest, seeing the rapidly improving technology as something the company needed to jump on. A.I. could help the social network recognize faces in photos and videos posted to its site, Mr. Schroepfer said, and could aid it in better targeting ads, organizing its News Feed and translating between languages. A.I. could also be applied to deliver digital widgets like “chatbots,” which are conversational systems that let businesses interact with customers.“We were going to hire some of the best people in the world,” Mr. Schroepfer said. “We were going to build a new kind of research lab.”Starting in 2013, Mr. Schroepfer began hiring researchers who specialized in neural networks, at a time when the stars of the field were paid millions or tens of millions of dollars over four or five years. On that Sunday in 2013 in Lake Tahoe, they did not succeed in hiring Dr. Farabet, who went on to create an A.I. start-up that Twitter later acquired. But Mr. Schroepfer brought in dozens of top researchers from places like Google, N.Y.U. and the University of Montreal.Mr. Schroepfer also built a second organization, the Applied Machine Learning team, which was asked to apply the Facebook A.I. lab’s technologies to real-world applications, like facial recognition, language translation and augmented reality tools.In late 2015, some of the A.I. work started to shift. The catalyst was the Paris terrorist attack, in which Islamic militants killed 130 people and wounded nearly 500 during coordinated attacks in and around the French capital. Afterward, Mr. Zuckerberg asked the Applied Machine Learning team what it might do to combat terrorism on Facebook, according to a person with knowledge of the company who was not authorized to speak publicly.In response, the team used technology developed inside the new Facebook A.I. lab to build a system to identify terrorist propaganda on the social network. The tool analyzed Facebook posts that mentioned the Islamic State or Al Qaeda and flagged those that most likely violated the company’s counterterrorism policies. Human curators then reviewed the posts.It was a turning point in Facebook’s effort to use A.I. to weed through posts and eliminate the problematic ones.That work soon gathered momentum. In November 2016, when Donald J. Trump was elected president, Facebook faced a backlash for fostering misinformation on its site that may have influenced voters and laid the groundwork for Mr. Trump’s win.Though the company initially dismissed its role in misinformation and the election, it started shifting technical resources in early 2017 to automatically identify a wide range of unwanted content, from nudity to fake accounts. It also created dozens of “integrity” positions dedicated to fighting unwanted content on subsections of its site.By mid-2017, the detection of toxic content accounted for more of the work at the Applied Machine Learning team than any other task. “The clear No. 1 priority for our content understanding work was integrity,” Mr. Schroepfer said.Then in March 2018, The New York Times and others reported that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the information of millions of Facebook users without their consent, to build voter profiles for the Trump campaign. The outcry against the social network mushroomed.Mr. Schroepfer was soon called to help deal with the controversy. In April 2018, he flew to London to be the designated executive to face questions from a British parliamentary committee about the Cambridge Analytica scandal. He was grilled for more than four hours as one parliamentary member after another heaped criticism on Facebook.“Mr. Schroepfer, you have a head of integrity?” Ian Lucas, a Labour Party politician, said to the grim-faced executive during the hearing, which was live streamed around the world. “I remain unconvinced that your company has integrity.”“It was too hard for me to watch,” said Forest Key, chief executive of a Seattle virtual reality start-up called Pixvana, who has known Mr. Schroepfer since they worked together at a movie effects technology start-up in the late 1990s. “What a burden. What a responsibility.”The challenge of using A.I. to contain Facebook’s content issues was on — and Mr. Schroepfer was in the hot seat.From his earliest days at Facebook, Mr. Schroepfer was viewed as a problem solver.Raised in Delray Beach, Fla., where his parents ran a 1,000-watt AM radio station that played rock ’n’ roll oldies before switching to R&B, Mr. Schroepfer moved to California in 1993 to attend Stanford. There, he majored in computer science for his undergraduate and graduate degrees, mingling with fellow technologists like Mr. Lilly and Adam Nash, who is now a top executive at the file-sharing company Dropbox.After graduating, Mr. Schroepfer stayed in Silicon Valley and went after thorny technical undertakings. He cut his teeth at a movie effects start-up and later founded a company that built software for massive computer data centers, which was acquired by Sun Microsystems. In 2005, he joined Mozilla as vice president for engineering. The San Francisco nonprofit had built a web browser to challenge the monopoly of Microsoft and its Internet Explorer browser. At the time, few technical tasks were as large.“Browsers are complex products, and the competitive landscape is weird,” said Mike Shaver, a founder of Mozilla, who worked alongside Mr. Schroepfer for several years. “Even early on in his career, I was never worried about his ability to handle it all.”In 2008, Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, stepped down as its head of engineering. Enter Mr. Schroepfer, who came to the company to take that role. Facebook served about two million people at the time, and his mandate was to keep the site up and running as its numbers of users exploded. The job involved managing thousands of engineers and tens of thousands of computer servers across the globe.“Most of the job was like a bus rolling downhill on fire with four flat tires. Like: How do we keep it going?” Mr. Schroepfer said. A big part of his day was “talking engineers off the ledge of quitting” because they were dealing with issues at all hours, he said.Over the next few years, his team built a range of new technologies for running a service so large. (Facebook has more than two billion users today.) It rolled out new programming tools to help the company deliver Facebook to laptops and phones more quickly and reliably. It introduced custom server computers in data centers to streamline the operation of the enormous computer network. In the end, Facebook significantly reduced service interruptions.“I can’t remember the last time I talked to an engineer who’s burned out because of scaling issues,” Mr. Schroepfer said.For his efforts, Mr. Schroepfer gained more responsibility. In 2013, he was promoted to chief technology officer. His mandate was to home in on brand-new areas of technology that the company should explore, with an eye on the future. As a sign of his role’s importance, he uses a desk beside Mr. Zuckerberg’s at Facebook headquarters and sits between the chief executive and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer.“He’s a good representation of how a lot of people at the company think and operate,” Mr. Zuckerberg said of Mr. Schroepfer. “Schrep’s superpower is being able to coach and build teams across very diverse problem areas. I’ve never worked really with anyone else who can do that like him.”So it was no surprise when Mr. Zuckerberg turned to Mr. Schroepfer to deal with all the toxicity streaming onto Facebook.Inside a Facebook conference room on a recent afternoon, Mr. Schroepfer pulled up two images on his Apple laptop computer. One was of broccoli, the other of clumped-up buds of marijuana. Everyone in the room stared at the images. Some of us were not quite sure which was which.Mr. Schroepfer had showed the pictures to make a point. Even though some of us were having trouble distinguishing between the two, Facebook’s A.I. systems were now able to pinpoint patterns in thousands of images so that it could recognize marijuana buds on their own. Once the A.I. flagged the pot images, many of which were attached to Facebook ads that used the photos to sell marijuana over the social network, the company could remove them.“We can now catch this sort of thing — proactively,” Mr. Schroepfer said.The problem was that the marijuana-versus-broccoli exercise was not just a sign of progress, but also of the limits that Facebook was hitting. Mr. Schroepfer’s team has built A.I systems that the company now uses to identify and remove pot images, nudity and terrorist-related content. But the systems are not catching all of those pictures, as there is always unexpected content, which means millions of nude, marijuana-related and terrorist-related posts continue reaching the eyes of Facebook users.Identifying rogue images is also one of the easier tasks for A.I. It is harder to build systems to identify false news stories or hate speech. False news stories can easily be fashioned to appear real. And hate speech is problematic because it is so difficult for machines to recognize linguistic nuances. Many nuances differ from language to language, while context around conversations rapidly evolves as they occur, making it difficult for the machines to keep up.Delip Rao, head of research at A.I. Foundation, a nonprofit that explores how artificial intelligence can fight disinformation, described the challenge as “an arms race.” A.I. is built from what has come before. But so often, there is nothing to learn from. Behavior changes. Attackers create new techniques. By definition, it becomes a game of cat and mouse.“Sometimes you are ahead of the people causing harm,” Mr. Rao said. “Sometimes they are ahead of you.”On that afternoon, Mr. Schroepfer tried to answer our questions about the cat-and-mouse game with data and numbers. He said Facebook now automatically removed 96 percent of all nudity from the social network. Hate speech was tougher, he said — the company catches 51 percent of that on the site. (Facebook later said this had risen to 65 percent.)Mr. Schroepfer acknowledged the arms race element. Facebook, which can automatically detect and remove problematic live video streams, did not identify the New Zealand video in March, he said, because it did not really resemble anything uploaded to the social network in the past. The video gave a first-person viewpoint, like a computer game.In designing systems that identify graphic violence, Facebook typically works backward from existing images — images of people kicking cats, dogs attacking people, cars hitting pedestrians, one person swinging a baseball bat at another. But, he said, “none of those look a lot like this video.”The novelty of that shooting video was why it was so shocking, Mr. Schroepfer said. “This is also the reason it did not immediately get flagged,” he said, adding that he had watched the video several times to understand how Facebook could identify the next one.“I wish I could unsee it,” he said.Follow Cade Metz and Mike Isaac on Twitter: @CadeMetz and @MikeIsaacInterested in All Things Tech?

      "<title data-rh=\"true\">The truth behind Facebook AI inventing a new language</title>\n",
      "There have been so many articles published about Facebook shutting down its robots after they developed their own language. The media is just loving these clickbait titles. Some of these articles would let you believe that this was a very close call — that scientists at Facebook barely shut down the AI before it could take over the world. Fortunately, there are still sane people out there, so there have been quite a few articles explaining why all of the doomsday talk is complete nonsense (like the ones published by Snopes or CNBC). Even some of the media that originally offered a very scandalous version of this event eventually edited the content to be less dramatic (like The Independent for example).The problem is that false but catchy news is much easier to spread than anything else. I also find it curious that none of the articles actually explained what happened in terms that people would understand. I tried to explain the situation to some of my friends and eventually decided that it was worth writing down. Maybe it will help people sleep without thinking of SKYNET. However, my goal is to educate — to show how so-called AI works — not to take sides.So what was Facebook actually doing? And how did the robots “almost become sentient”? The whole project is well-documented and available to the general public. Anyone can actually download and run this AI, as well as observe the new language on their own. Just please be careful and shut it down in time like the Facebook engineers did.The system tries to simulate dialog and negotiation. The so-called robot is given a set of items (consisting of books, hats, and balls) and some preferences for which items it wants more than others. Then it is supposed to negotiate with its counterparty, be it a human or another robot, about how to split the treasure among themselves.The research was published in June, including all code and training data used for the experiment. If you are interested in more details, read the official article or just get the code from github.So how does it work in simple terms?I will not bother you with all the technical details, but it is important to understand some basic principles about how this technology works.When developing a robot like this, you start with something called a “training data set”. This consists of well-described examples of the behavior that the robot is trying to simulate. In the particular case of the Facebook negotiation chat bot, you give it examples of negotiation dialogs with the whole situation properly annotated — what the initial state was, the preferences of the negotiator, what was said, what the result was, etc. The program analyzes all these examples, extracts some features of each dialog, and assigns a number to these features, representing how often dialogs with that feature ended in positive results for the negotiator. To better imagine what a “feature” is, think words, phrases, and sentences. In reality it is more complicated than that, but it is good enough to get the principle.To be more specific, if the robot wants hats, the phrase “You can have all the hats” will have a really low score because this sentence ended with a bad result in every scenario from the training data— the negotiator did not get what he wanted.This will basically get you version zero of your AI. It now knows which sentences are more likely to get a good deal from the negotiation. You can use it to start a dialog. It will try to maximize the probability of a positive outcome based on the numbers gathered during the training phase. The term AI feels kinda weird here — it is very artificial, but not very intelligent. It does not understand the meaning of what it is saying. It has a very limited set of dialogs to relate to, and it just picks some words or phrases based on probabilities calculated from those historical dialogs. It cannot do anything else. It just calculates the probability of getting the desired amount of hats, balls or books, and based on that it writes something on the screen.The next step is using a technique called reinforcement learning. As our ability to provide well-annotated training data is fairly limited, we need another way for this AI to learn. One of the common approaches is to let the AI run a simulation, and learn from its own results. Before I explain what this meant for the negotiation robot case, let me sidestep to a different AI.Google Deepmind AlphaGo is a program that you may have heard about last year. It was the first AI to beat a professional Go player. And it is a perfect example of reinforcement learning in action.AlphaGo started learning from real games played by real people. It analyzed and scored each possible move based on this knowledge. This alone made AlphaGo capable of playing, albeit very poorly — it did not understand the game, but it had a way to score the moves based on previously analyzed games.But, Go is fairly easy to simulate. We have an exact set of rules and we have a very good goal for the AI — to win the game. So we can just create two instances of such an AI and let it play against itself. Since we have a lot of computing power available, it can easily play millions of games to train, many more than any human ever could. It then updates the probabilities of a win for each move based on all of these simulated results, getting better and better at scoring the moves well.Again, I am simplifying the concept. If you want to learn more about AlphaGo, I can recommend this article from Christopher Burger. I just want you to take one thing away from this example. Reinforcement learning work really, really well (as proven by AlphaGo and many others) if we can satisfy three conditions:So let’s look back at the original topic. Facebook was trying to create a robot that could negotiate. How well does it fit the three conditions above? There is a great way to score the outcome as there is a value assigned to each item that is part of the negotiation. We have a good way to simulate the situation and let the AI learn. That is exactly what Facebook did — let two instances of the robot negotiate with each other. But the last point is slightly problematic.Unlike with the game of Go, there is no easy definition of the English language. The original training data set was in English, but the extracted features were just words and phrases, and the robot was just putting them together based on the numerical representation of how likely they were going to help get the desired outcome.Two robots that do not actually understand English ended up talking to one another and learning from one another. The only measure of their success was how well they distributed books, hats, and balls. The only rule to follow was to put words on the screen. They started talking more or less in English, but they were learning from their own mistakes, without knowing they were actually mistakes — led to the desired outcome in the form of hats, books, and balls. Some words got lost because according to the numbers, they did not contribute to the negotiation outcome. Some got multiplied. If saying “I want” improves the chance of getting something, then why shouldn't we say it multiple times, right? And once this works, the AI will take it as confirmation that this is a good strategy.If it was training against a human being, this would probably not be such a big problem, as the other side would be using proper language. There would be a different problem though. It would be difficult to run a large enough number of simulations to train the AI.As Facebook engineers noted, it could have worked better if the scoring function had also included a language check, rather than only the total value of items received after the negotiation. But it didn’t. The fact that the language degenerated is neither surprising nor interesting in any way. It happens to every scientist working on these types of problems, and I am sure Facebook engineers actually expected that result. They just turned off the simulation once it degenerated too much, after many iterations, and after it stopped providing useful results.By the way, if you read the report or the published paper, apart from the gibberish conversation that was shared all over the internet, there were actually many good results as well. The experiment worked as intended, and I would say was pretty successful overall.Nothing scary, shocking or even note-worthy happened. Just a regular day with a regular scientific experiment. And then all hell broke loose as wanna-be journalists posted one doomsday article after another. Shutting down a chat bot when it stops showing a reasonable outcome is about as ominous as changing a faulty light bulb.Written by\n"

Here's a rundown of the key differences between the two.One of the biggest differences lies in the underlying technology behind both currencies.With bitcoin, transactions are recorded anonymously on a public ledger known as the blockchain. It's essentially a database maintained by a network of computers, on which transactions are secured in such a way that makes it virtually impossible to tamper with.Libra also uses a form of blockchain, or distributed ledger technology. But unlike bitcoin, Libra's blockchain is permissioned — at least for now — meaning that transactions can only be added to it by a group of trusted parties.That's where the Libra Association, a Switzerland-based consortium of companies including Visa and Uber, comes in. Each of the nonprofit organization's members have invested a minimum of $10 million into the project. \"Libra will create a centralized structure governed by an unelected 'association' composed exclusively of large institutions who have purchased their voting rights,\" said Ido Sadeh Man, founder and president of the Saga Foundation, a cryptocurrency firm that counts J.P. Morgan Chairman Jacob Frenkel as an advisor.It's different to bitcoin's network, which can be accessed and maintained by anyone with decent enough hardware and access to the internet. \"Cryptocurrencies are defined by their lack of reliance on trusted intermediaries,\" Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at the cryptocurrency policy think-tank Coin Center, said in a recent blog post. \"We believe that Libra is not a cryptocurrency because of its use of a permissioned ledger and its reliance on a trusted issuer to hold and manage a fund of assets that back the currency.\"Bitcoin's white paper describes the virtual currency as a peer-to-peer payment system, allowing people to exchange money without going through a bank.It's commonly used today as a form of investment, with the term  \"HODL\" being a common slang phrase in the industry to describe buying and staying invested in the cryptocurrency for the long term. It's frequently been referred to as \"digital gold. \"Libra's primary purpose is to be used in cross-border payments and money transfers. The currency is tied to a basket of government-backed currencies and other assets, to avoid the volatile swings often seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.Referred to by many in the industry as a  \"stablecoin,\" Libra is aimed at maintaining a stable value. David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the blockchain initiative, has previously said it will work \"more like a traditional currency\" than a cryptocurrency. \"Bitcoin and Facebook's Libra both represent stages in the evolution of currency but in starkly different ways,\" Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of digital currency comparison platform CryptoCompare, told CNBC.Each morning, the “Beyond the Valley” newsletter brings you all the latest from the vast, dynamic world of tech – outside the Silicon Valley.By signing up for newsletters, you are agreeing to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.  \"Bitcoin is permissionless, fully decentralized, deflationary and volatile. Libra is permissioned, more centralized, governed by supply and demand and pegged to fiat currencies.\"What Hayter means by  \"governed by supply and demand\" is that Facebook and its partner companies can adjust the supply to match a quantity of other assets held in reserve, effectively maintaining a stable price even when demand changes.Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply. The total number of bitcoins that will ever be minted is  \"hard-capped\" at 21 million. \"Bitcoin supply is fixed and cannot react to the market's demand,\" the Saga Foundation's Sadeh Man said. \"Libras are created or burned when one of Libra's authorized resellers deposit or withdraw money from its reserve.\"Facebook's currency has taken the spotlight when it comes to talk of regulating cryptocurrencies. But some worry the company's blockchain project could be lumped in with other digital assets by regulators.That would be problematic given the difference between Libra and a digital currency like bitcoin. Whereas bitcoin rules out the need for financial intermediaries, Libra's model is reliant on the entities which form the Libra Association, Coin Center's Van Valkenburgh said. \"A system without intermediaries is a system without intermediary risk, and thus no need for regulation aimed at safeguarding against the types of risk presented by intermediaries,\" he said.The Libra Association currently consists of 28 founding members, according to the Libra white paper, and is hoping to reach 100 members by the time the currency launches. The token is slated for launch in the first half of 2020.Though bitcoin's network involves so-called  \"miners\" who record transactions, it wouldn't make sense to regulated them as they aren't trusted custodians of user funds, Van Valkenburgh said. Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets on the other hand do require regulatory oversight, he added.Questions around how Libra would fit into existing financial regulations were raised at Wednesday's hearing. Facebook's Marcus was grilled on whether Libra could be considered a financial security, which he said could not be the case. But Marcus said it could possibly be considered a commodity.Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton last year told CNBC that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could not be viewed as securities. Cryptocurrencies are  \"replacements for sovereign currencies\" like the dollar and the euro, he said.Regardless, if Facebook and its partners do manage to overcome the regulatory hurdles that have accompanied Libra, the currency  \"will undoubtedly have an enormous impact on the global economy — possibly eclipsing that of bitcoin,\" CryptoCompare's Hayter said.For Andy Bryant, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer's European business, Libra could start to convince people there are  \"other ways\" of storing value than using fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. \"If that's all that Libra achieves, I think it will be a great step forward,\" he said.Got a confidential news tip?

      "<title>Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra, explained - The Verge</title>\n",
      "Filed under:Move fast and bank thingsWhat is Libra?It’s an excellent book by Don DeLillo, the American master. Published in 1988, it is a fictional account of the life of Lee Harvey Oswald, President John F. Kennedy’s eventual assassin. It’s better than White Noise but not as good as Underworld.Liz.Fine. It’s Facebook’s new cryptocurrency. The point is that you can send money all over the world with lower fees than if you were to engage, say, Western Union.It’s shady as hell, though. You remember Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss? The twins from whom Mark Zuckerberg ripped the initial idea for Facebook? Yeah, so they have a cryptocurrency exchange called Gemini. As any astrology buff will tell you, both Libra and Gemini are air signs, and Geminis are stereotypically scarier than Libras. Gemini is the sign of twins and is associated with two-faced-ness. Plus, it’s a mutable air sign, which makes it somewhat unstable. Libra, as a cardinal sign, is somewhat more stable. Libra sees both sides; Gemini tries to be both sides. On the other hand, astrology is made up. On some theoretical third hand: so is money!What I’m trying to say here is that Zuckerberg seems to love crushing the dreams of these handsome men, so who can say how this will turn out? Anyway, the name seems kind of bitchy.Is Libra a cryptocurrency?This is kind of a contentious question. Relative to the US dollar, the euro, or the yen, it’s decidedly a cryptocurrency because there’s no central bank. There’s also a public ledger, although only some people are allowed to mine the coin. So I chatted with some experts to find out whether Libra is a cryptocurrency.“It’s fair enough to say this uses cryptocurrency technology,” says Matthew Green, an associate professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University. (Facebook contacted Green “a few weeks ago” and asked him if he’d look at its white paper as an outside reviewer. This was unpaid work Green would have had to sign a nondisclosure agreement to perform. He declined.) “It’s more restricted in the way the blockchain works, but even that’s not totally unprecedented.”Compared to the OG cryptocurrency, bitcoin, well… it looks less like a cryptocurrency. For instance: bitcoin is a permissionless system. You participate through proof of work by competing to solve a puzzle that lets you add a block to its chain. What that means, essentially, is that anyone can participate. This is one of the most significant ideas behind Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 paper: bitcoin requires consensus, not trust. Libra, by contrast, is permissioned, meaning only a few trusted entities can keep track of the ledger. That makes it more like a digital currency rather than a cryptocurrency, says Lana Swartz, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia who’s studied the bitcoin community extensively. “I actually agree with the folks who’ve been saying that this actually isn’t really a cryptocurrency at all,” Swartz says.On the other hand, Libra is assigned to pseudonymous “wallets,” and transfers are done through public key operations, says Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute and a lecturer in the computer science department at the University of California, Berkeley. “So yes,” he told me, “it is a cryptocurrency.” Weaver also notes that the permissioned model means less computing power is needed. Bitcoin wastes a lot of energy, preventing so-called Sybil attacks in which an attacker fills the network with computers the attacker controls and wreaks havoc.The only conclusion I have come to is that there is no stable definition of “cryptocurrency,” so I am going to just call Libra a cryptocurrency for the sake of ease and keep it moving. If you’d like to put an asterisk on that, I can’t blame you.Why is decentralized currency exciting to some people?Well, theoretically, removing the central bank from the equation democratizes currency. In practice, that’s not exactly how it works out. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine has explained this very succinctly, so I’m just going to paraphrase him. It’s true that the internet is, in some ways, decentralized since it’s not controlled by the government or a specific corporation. But the result is that certain massive tech companies run most of the infrastructure: internet search is Google, email is Gmail, cloud computing that powers most websites is Amazon. “The democratizing effect of the internet’s openness and decentralization is counteracted by its vast economies of scale and network effects, which tend to concentrate power in a few big winners,” Levine writes. And Facebook wants to be cryptocurrency’s big winner.I’ve heard Libra is a “stablecoin.” What is that, and how does it figure into this?Libra is a stablecoin — kind of! Unfortunately, much like “cryptocurrency,” this is something of a semantic gray area. Basically, any cryptocurrency pegged to either a fiat currency (say, the US dollar) or some kind of government-backed security (like a bond) counts as a stablecoin. The idea is that there’s more stability — hence the name — and less volatility than in something like bitcoin, which isn’t pegged to anything. Bitcoin is exactly as valuable as people believe bitcoin is, which makes it very, very volatile.Unlike most stablecoins, though, Libra isn’t pegged to one specific currency. Libra is pegged to a group of “of low-volatility assets, including bank deposits and government securities” in multiple currencies. While there is a Libra Reserve, Libra doesn’t seem like it’s necessarily pegged to its value. Rather, the reserve functions as a kind of lower bound on Libra’s value.That means that there’s just one Libra, no matter where you live. Levine is great here, too, so I am going to paraphrase him again: if Libra does catch on, it’s likely to displace currencies like the dollar. That’s because if you spend mostly Libra, perhaps because you buy most things online, you’ll only convert your Libras into dollars for when you need to spend IRL money, and the dollar will begin to seem annoying to you since it keeps moving up and down relative to the Libra. “The goal is for Libra to be more useful than any national currency, accepted in more places and with fewer complications; pegging it to a single national currency would only hold it back,” Levine writes.What else do I need to know about the reserve?Again, if you think about the classic cryptocurrency, bitcoin, its monetary policy is pretty sparse: there’s a finite number of bitcoins that can ever exist, and the number of bitcoins that are released by mining decreases over time. That is bitcoin’s entire monetary policy. That’s it!By contrast, the governing members of Libra will be setting some kind of policy by picking the basket of investments used for the reserve. (They have said: “The association does not set monetary policy. It mints and burns coins only in response to demand from authorized resellers.” But Tyler Cowen helpfully points out that there’s some debate about what monetary policy is.)The reserve will come initially from Facebook and its partners, but later, if you buy Libra (Libras? This also seems semantically unclear to me) for cash, your cash will be part of the reserve. That reserve is then “invested in low-risk assets that will yield interest over time.”There’s a different hitch here, though. Under normal circumstances, like with a bank deposit, you’d get to keep the interest. But with Libra, that’s not the case. Don’t take my word for it, this is from Libra itself:The revenue from this interest will first go to support the operating expenses of the association — to fund investments in the growth and development of the ecosystem, grants to nonprofit and multilateral organizations, engineering research, etc. Once that is covered, part of the remaining returns will go to pay dividends to early investors in the Libra Investment Token for their initial contributions.So any interest from Libra will go primarily to Libra and then to early Libra investors like… Facebook. Isn’t that fun! It’s also how Venmo and PayPal make money: any cash that’s held in those systems is cash they get to keep the interest on, per their user agreements.Don’t cryptocurrencies typically run on a blockchain? Does Libra?Let’s start by... uh… defining blockchain. Just kidding, you can’t. If you look through the white papers, you’ll notice this, like, capitalization thing. Libra Blockchain, in these papers, always takes a capital. And while I love capitalizing things for no reason, my editors consistently remind me that it makes my copy harder to read, and the joke is usually only funny to me. Now it’s possible the itty-bitty blockchain committee shares my amazingly sophisticated sense of humor, but what seems more likely is that some sleight of hand is going on. For instance, check out this paragraph from the white paper:In order to securely store transactions, data on the Libra Blockchain is protected by Merkle trees, a data structure used by other blockchains that enables the detection of any changes to existing data. Unlike previous blockchains, which view the blockchain as a collection of blocks of transactions, the Libra Blockchain is a single data structure that records the history of transactions and states over time. This implementation simplifies the work of applications accessing the blockchain, allowing them to read any data from any point in time and verify the integrity of that data using a unified framework.Libra Blockchain takes capital letters, but the regular blockchain doesn’t. Isn’t that interesting! What’s even more interesting is the sentence that starts “Unlike previous blockchains...” If the Libra Blockchain isn’t using blocks for transactions, is it even a blockchain?Whatever it is, it doesn’t work, according to this Bloomberg piece — at least not yet. But what it does seem like from these materials is that, actually, Libra isn’t very decentralized.What do you mean?I keep noticing there’s this stuff in here about being decentralized “in the future,” but from the jump, it’s coming out in centralized form. They call this centralization “permissioned” in the paperwork. Basically, the first version of Libra is controlled by the founding coiners. You know, the ones who also get to keep the interest. (There is a vague plan for expanding this initial cabal in five years or so. Any new members of the cabal will have to meet its requirements, which are substantial.)Ugh, that sounds like fiat currency.Actually, it’s worse. In the white papers, there’s a possibility that your data could be archived for a fee to save space. I am pleased to report that the Fed can’t pull that shit. Paper money 4eva.But it’s worse for another reason, too. The thing about cryptocurrency is that it does everything regular currency does but way slower. That’s because of the blockchain: doing all of that computation slows your transaction. Libra’s setup makes the transactions a little faster, but not nearly as fast as traditional payments processors. It looks like Libra can do about 1,000 transactions per second, says Green. A traditional payments processor like Visa can do about 3,000 transactions per second. So it might be reasonable for Facebook to do something else, rather than all those individual transactions. Aggregate all of its users’ Netflix bills into one giant bill, and then allow one giant transaction to cover the whole thing, Green says.So is that private?This is Facebook. Your privacy does not exist to Facebook. If you trust Zuckerberg, it’s worth remembering that he thinks you are “dumb fucks.” He’s apologized for this exchange, but I have to say, in light of how Facebook has treated privacy, I think he’s mostly just sorry we know about it.“They’ve sort of hand-waved around the idea that their business model isn’t rooted in user data, but I can’t imagine that there isn’t an interest there,” Swartz says. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire shares her skepticism. “This money will allow this company to assemble even more data, which only increases our determination to regulate the internet giants,” Le Maire said, according to Bloomberg.In the example I just used of a large, aggregated Netflix bill, there’s still the problem of Facebook itself knowing your transaction history, which isn’t great. But this is the best-case scenario.There is a vision of Libra where people just… use it, like at physical locations or to send money to individual people. And unlike a bank transfer, this won’t be private information. In that world, the privacy problem can be pretty bad, Green says, because every business doing anything on that layer is visible. “Then, all of a sudden, you have Twitter for your bank account, where everyone in the world learns all the transactions that you make.” So a lot like Venmo?Yeah, but with a much larger user base. Imagine the scale here, which is deliberately international. There are almost certainly governments that would be interested in the transaction data, particularly if it’s granular, says Green.But I don’t get privacy at my bank, do I?Well, you do and you don’t. Chase is not broadcasting the details of everywhere I sent money, so, in that sense, it’s more private. But in another important sense, Chase is less private. That’s because of the Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws, which, in the US, mandate that certain parts of my identity be divulged by my bank to the US government and also that my bank assess how likely it is that I’m doing crimes (like, for instance, money laundering). Those laws seem like something Facebook should be paying close attention to if it is serious about Libra. The laws also vary on a country-by-country basis. Seems like a lot of overhead for regulatory compliance, if you ask me!So far, how Libra will deal with those laws is kind of vague. “They’re doing a weird dance between like, oh, we’re kind of going to be light on KYC and super inclusive, but also we’re going to be really by the book regulatory,” Swartz says. “They’re seeming to play it both ways.”But that’s not all. There’s also the IRS. So if Libra is a cryptocurrency — and, again, it does kind of seem to be one — it’s classed by the IRS as a commodity, like pork bellies or gold. That has tax implications, Weaver tells me. Remember how cryptocurrencies are usually kind of volatile, and Libra is designed deliberately to be less so? That doesn’t necessarily guarantee low or no volatility. So if I’m taking my paycheck in Libra, and the value of Libra relative to the dollar goes up while the money is being transferred such that I make $100 extra, that $100 is taxable. That means something for me, sure, but it also means something for Facebook, Weaver wrote:[S]ince any integration into Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp is under the control of Facebook, Facebook should probably file income tax documents and keep track of the otherwise difficult cost-basis math on behalf of Facebook’s customers, like other investment brokerages do. The IRS needs to remind both Facebook and the public of these implications and requirements. Of course, this would make Libra completely useless in the U.S. by increasing the cost of using it beyond any utility.When we spoke on the phone, Weaver told me that true financial privacy is “a vehicle for bad outcomes.” What you want is a company that doesn’t allow privacy but is good at protecting your data. “And since Facebook is notorious for misusing data, the notion of giving Facebook insight into a whole bunch of financial transactions is just flat out disturbing.” It’s not just Facebook. It’s also everyone who has a node to help process these transactions, right?Yeah, and that brings us to another potential legal hurdle: keeping banking and commerce separate. Facebook has 27 partners, including Visa, Mastercard, eBay, PayPal, Stripe, Spotify, Uber, Lyft, and Coinbase. Depending on what data is visible to them, there may be some legal kinks to work out, writes Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute: Since the Civil War, the United States has had a general prohibition on the intersection between banking and commerce. Such a barrier has been reinforced many times, such as in 1956 with the Bank Holding Company Act and in 1970 with an amendment to that law during the conglomerate craze. Both times, Congress blocked banks from going into nonbanking businesses through holding companies, because Americans historically didn’t want banks competing with their own customers. Banking and payments is a special business, where a bank gets access to intimate business secrets of its customers. As one travel agent told Congress in 1970 when opposing the right of banks to enter his business, “Any time I deposited checks from my customers,” he said, “I was providing the banks with the names of my best clients.” Imagine Facebook’s subsidiary Calibra knowing your account balance and your spending, and offering to sell a retailer an algorithm that will maximize the price for what you can afford to pay for a product. Imagine this cartel having this kind of financial visibility into not only many consumers, but into businesses across the economy. Such conflicts of interest are why payments and banking are separated from the rest of the economy in the United States.Yikes.Yikes is right. And that’s before we get to the possibility of scammers! Look, the entire draw of cryptocurrency for the nerds who started the bitcoin community was the lack of interference, Green says. But most of us aren’t sophisticated enough to function without some kind of safety net. And the reality is that bitcoin created a lot of opportunity for scams and extortion. Remember when all those “Elon Musks” showed up on Twitter hawking crypto scams? Also, Weaver points out, cryptocurrency is the preferred vehicle for ransomware. Those were problems among early adopters who tend to be savvier than us normies. There’s a world in which a billion people adopting Libra leads to those problems on an unimaginably huge scale.Weaver views scams as being of some concern, but extortion worries him more. For instance, he points out, a major limiting factor on online drug markets is that paying with bitcoin is a pain in the ass. But an easily accessible cryptocurrency — one that has privacy protections that keep everyone from seeing who you send money to — makes it way easier to pay for illegal drugs online. “I like to say that cryptocurrency has committed a crime against me,” Weaver says. “It has made me believe in the need for rigorous enforcement of money laundering laws.”So can Libra be stopped?Who can say?Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), the chairwoman of the House Finance Committee, is asking House leadership to join her in demanding that Facebook halt Libra’s development until Congress reviews Libra, Bloomberg has reported. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has scheduled a hearing for July 16th. Facebook has been invited to testify at a hearing of the financial services panel on July 17th, so pop your popcorn!But legal and regulatory hurdles can be removed in some cases. Or Mark Zuckerberg could go all honey badger about it and dare governments to come get him. It’s 2019, and anything is possible. I will say, however, that I find this all to be very entertaining, and I would like to share with you what may be the most implausible way to stop Libra, and it involves presidential hopeful Howard Schultz. Before he decided to run for president, Schultz was just the billionaire CEO of Starbucks. During an earnings call last year, he said legitimate cryptocurrencies were on their way. (Bitcoin is not legit, in Schultz’s view.) His comments sounded like a big hint that Starbucks was working on cryptocurrencies, or at least the blockchain, in some capacity. People don’t trust Facebook. They do trust Starbucks. Trust is a huge part of how money works, Swartz tells me. Starbucks has a greater geographical reach in terms of branches than any bank in the world, she says. It has a heavily used payment app and some of the most sophisticated fintech in the world. So maybe that’s the answer: Starbucks launches StarBucks, its own branded cryptocurrency, and it just massacres Libra because we like and trust Starbucks, and we don’t like or trust Facebook.That’s what I’m rooting for, anyway.\n"

      "<title data-rh=\"true\">Facebook Cryptocurrency Plans Have a Problem: Facebook’s Reputation - The New York Times</title>\n",
      "AdvertisementSupported byBy Mike Isaac and Nathaniel PopperLawmakers made it clear at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday that they believe the biggest roadblock to Facebook’s plan to enter the world of cryptocurrency and global finance is the company’s reputation.Facebook’s cryptocurrency project, Libra, has been in the works for more than a year. It has an ambitious goal: to offer an alternative financial system that makes it possible to send money around the world with few fees.But almost immediately, the company has run into resistance from Washington.“Facebook is dangerous,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said at the hearing. “Facebook has said ‘just trust us.’ And every time Americans trust you, they seem to get burned.”The initiative is far from the first effort of its kind. The best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is in wide circulation, and it introduced the idea of digital currencies that are free from government control.But the Libra effort has put a spotlight on cryptocurrencies and amplified the voices of critics who say the technology has little value beyond speculative investing and illegal transactions, like online drug sales.When Facebook announced Libra in June, it also faced immediate skepticism from people who are wary of the power the social media company has already accumulated. Within days, regulators in Washington were calling for hearings on Facebook’s plans.That concern was obvious on Tuesday when members of the committee questioned David Marcus, who leads the company’s cryptocurrency initiative, for more than two hours. Mr. Marcus was asked about a range of Facebook controversies, from lax protection of the private information of its users to Russian disinformation on Facebook’s platforms to claims that is tries to muzzle conservative viewpoints.“Why in the world should Facebook of all companies do this?” asked Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii. “Maybe before you do a new thing you should make sure you have your own shop fixed.”Mr. Marcus, adopting a conciliatory tone, said the company would do its best to fight fraud and to earn back the trust of the more than two billion people who use Facebook’s services regularly.“We’ve made mistakes in the past,” Mr. Marcus said. “We have been working, and are working hard to get better.”The Senate session was the first in a day of Capitol Hill hearings involving the technology industry. House lawmakers were set to question multiple tech executives at an afternoon hearing focused on competition issues as part of a broad antitrust inquiry. And Google executives were scheduled to face questions at another hearing on the subject of whether the company censors conservative voices.Facebook officials will also have to answer more questions about the company’s cryptocurrency plans in a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Wednesday.Some lawmakers and regulators — most notably at the Securities and Exchange Commission — have been raising concerns about the legality and usefulness of cryptocurrencies for some time.The involvement of Facebook, which has faced an onslaught of controversy over the last two years and is expected to pay a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, has put a charge into those discussions.Last week, the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said Libra raised “serious concerns” around “money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.”“I just think it cannot go forward without there being broad satisfaction with the way the company has addressed money laundering” and other issues, Mr. Powell said as he testified before the House Financial Services Committee. Central bankers from Britain, China, France, Singapore and the European Central Bank  have all voiced similar concerns.President Trump also criticized Libra and Bitcoin, writing on Twitter last week that the digital tokens were “highly volatile and based on thin air.”And at a  news conference on Monday afternoon, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also raised questions about Libra and other cryptocurrencies. Facebook has “a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we’re comfortable with it,” Mr. Mnuchin told reporters.The issue provides a rare instance when the Trump administration is lining up with Democrats rather than other Republicans. While Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee lashed into Facebook, several Republicans on the committee voiced support for Facebook and its new initiative.“I just think we should be exploring this and considering the benefits as well as the risks,” said Patrick Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. “To announce in advance that we have to strangle this baby in the crib seems wildly premature.”But not all Republicans on the committee were so positive.Martha McSally, a Republican from Arizona, said “I don’t trust you guys.”And Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, worried that conservatives would not be treated fairly in the Libra system, echoing a frequent Republican talking point about the liberal bias of tech companies.Mr. Marcus, a former PayPal executive, was handpicked by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to lead the Libra effort.Facebook’s role in the project will be run through a subsidiary company called Calibra, led by Mr. Marcus and other top Facebook employees. If the Libra digital token become popular, Calibra could build a business around offering customer financial services, including loans and other actions traditionally offered by the banking industry.A separate entity called the Libra Association, whose proposed board would include more than a dozen partners in the tech and financial industries, would manage the cryptocurrency system once it is up and running, which Facebook is hoping to do next year.Mr. Brown asked if there was any amount of opposition that would convince Facebook to scrap Libra.“Is there anything that elected leaders can say that will convince you and Facebook that it should not launch this currency?” he said.Mr. Marcus said that the company would not move ahead with the project until the concerns of regulators are answered.Follow Mike Isaac and Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @nathanielpopperAdvertisement\n",

      "August 1, 2019From Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Social media giant Facebook announced in June that it would launch Libra, a new cryptocurrency, in the first half of next year. Users will be able to buy things and send money to other people rapidly, anonymously and with fees of a fraction of a cent, and Facebook says it’s targeting the unbanked. So what is Libra? How is it different from other cryptocurrencies? And are there investment opportunities in this new virtual currency?See Also: 2019's Hot IPOs: What the Analysts ThinkSpoiler alert: Libra is designed not to fluctuate much, so investing directly in the cryptocurrency probably won’t do much for you. It could face steep opposition in Congress and from governments around the world. Moreover, you shouldn’t invest in any cryptocurrency unless you’re prepared to lose your entire investment. And although there are some indirect ways to invest in the crypto boom, these, too, are highly speculative. Here’s what you need to know:How is Libra different from Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a virtual currency that has no central governing authority, such as a central bank. Users can buy and sell Bitcoins anonymously and use them to make untraceable purchases. Bitcoin uses blockchain technology—think of a decentralized ledger of transactions shared and maintained across a vast network of computers—that its advocates say makes counterfeiting impossible.Like Bitcoin, Libra will use blockchain technology and allow users to be anonymous. That’s where the similarities end. What makes cryptocurrency problematic as a currency is that its price can swing wildly. Bitcoin, for example, has fluctuated between $1,914 and $19,345 over the past two years. But Libra’s value will be tied to a pool of money in the Libra Reserve, which gets its cash from the members of the Libra Association, a Swiss nonprofit that will oversee the cryptocurrency. The association has 28 initial members, including Facebook, Visa and PayPal, as well as a few nonprofit organizations, such as Kiva, a microlender.Each member kicks in $10 million to the Libra Reserve. The Libra Association could grow to about 100 members, says Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi. You will be able to exchange Libras for money in the reserve, which in turn will be invested in various government bonds and currencies. The reserve’s owners will pocket the interest from those investments.In order to use Libras, you’ll need a crypto wallet, an app that lets you turn Libras into dollars (and vice versa). Facebook will offer a wallet through a subsidiary, Calibra, which will allow users to send money to anyone with a smartphone and may eventually allow direct purchases. You’ll also be able use other wallets currently on the market to store Libras. Calibra will ensure the separation of social media information and financial information, Facebook says.Why is Facebook creating Libra? In a white paper, Facebook says Libra will help provide basic financial services to people who lack bank accounts. It will also make it easier for people in one country to send money to relatives in another country. With 2.4 billion users, Facebook will have a huge, ready-made pool of potential Libra users, all of whom could use the currency to buy things they see on the social network.Although Facebook says that data from those who use Libra won’t be sold or used for targeted ads, skeptics abound. \"They are not rolling out Libra for philanthropic reasons,\" says Adam Levin, Founder of CyberScout. \"They are trying to find additional ways to scoop up information about people’s habits.\"Nevertheless, Libra will allow Facebook to diversify itself from advertising revenue. Facilitating payments is a lucrative business. Mastercard, for example, sports a 56.9% operating margin, a measure of profitability that shows how much a company makes on each dollar of sales after paying for wages and materials but before paying interest or tax. \"Everyone wants to get into payments, and now it’s Facebook’s turn,\" says John Freeman, vice president of stock research at CFRA. And Facebook will also get a slice of interest payments from the Libra Reserve fund.What are the drawbacks for Facebook? Facebook is already in the crosshairs because of consumer privacy concerns. In July, the Federal Trade Commission approved a $5 billion settlement with Facebook over its privacy practices. Libra will likely add to those worries. Congress has been scrutinizing tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon for possible antitrust practices. The Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasury have expressed concerns.Since news of Facebook’s intention to debut an anonymous payment system, congressional hearing schedules have been filling up fast, and executives are facing a number of potentially grueling appearances on Capitol Hill. \"With Facebook exerting such a tremendous amount of influence and power over politics, those writing legislation have a very personal motivation\" to limit Facebook’s influence, says Freeman.A broader worry is that the public may not trust Facebook enough to use Libra. All currency, whether crypto or paper, relies on trust for acceptance. Given consumers’ concerns about their privacy on Facebook, the public could be slow to accept Libra. And although Bitcoins seem to be unhackable, the wallets that hold them are not, nor are the exchanges that trade them—and once your crypto wallet is hacked, your cryptocurrency is gone forever. (Facebook says it will refund users if their Calibra accounts are compromised and they lose their Libras, but it hasn’t shared specifics.)What effect will Libra have on the rest of the cryptocurrency market? Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency in the world—in fact, there are more than 1,000. After Bitcoin, some of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin and EOS. All other things being equal, if Libra becomes popular and accepted, it would draw investors away from other cryptocurrencies and push down their prices.But you shouldn’t invest in any of them unless it’s with money you’re willing to lose. A stock has earnings and dividends behind it; the U.S. Treasury has the vast U.S. military behind it, as well as extensive policing powers. Bitcoin and other cryptos? Nothing. Joseph Stiglitz, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, says Libra doesn’t offer much, either. \"Why would anyone give Facebook a zero-interest deposit, when they could put their money in an even-safer U.S. Treasury bill or in a money market fund?\" he recently wrote in a syndicated column. One answer, of course, is to shield criminal activities because the transactions can’t be traced.But people have made money in Bitcoin. What are the investment opportunities in Libra or other cryptocurrencies? People invest in Bitcoin simply because they hope its price will go up, that the next person will be willing to pay more than they did. This is known on Wall Street as the Greater Fool Theory. Libra’s value will be tied to real currency, so there’s not as much potential for it to rise or fall dramatically. You’re unlikely to become a Libra billionaire, unless you’re Mark Zuckerberg.Several companies do benefit from cryptocurrencies, but the benefits can be fleeting. Bitcoin mining, a process of solving complex math problems to get new Bitcoins and verify transaction ledgers, requires a vast amount of processing power. Stock in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has soared 80% this year, in part because its processors are prized for mining Bitcoin. However, application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, that are made especially for Bitcoin mining are now preferred. And demand for those chips rises and falls with the price of Bitcoin.Blockchain technology does have legitimate—and promising—business use. Financial services firms can use blockchain to keep records of complex trades and contracts. Nasdaq, for example, offers a blockchain service through its Nasdaq Financial Framework. Amazon.com offers a service for companies to create their own blockchain services. For now, we think blockchain technology is interesting to watch but not yet something most investors should put their money on.And what about Facebook (FB)? Morningstar’s Mogharabi thinks that Libra won’t do much for Facebook’s earnings for the next few years. CFRA’s Freeman agrees and says investors should be more interested in Facebook Watch, the company’s YouTube competitor, which now has 140 million daily views—a fraction of YouTube’s typical traffic, but growing. \"That’s the new thing from Facebook to get excited about,\" he says.1100 13th Street, NW, Suite 750\n",

      "<title>For Facebook’s Cryptocurrency, the Well May Already Be Poisoned</title>\n",
      "assessmentsAug 15, 2019 | 09:30 GMTIn June, Facebook made waves when it confirmed it was planning to launch its own cryptocurrency in 2020. Called Libra, the system will be connected to Facebook's massive user base, granting it the immediate potential of rivaling such established systems as Google Pay and PayPal. Indeed, Libra hopes to become the world's most widely adopted digital currency — sparking the kind of economic revolution that cryptocurrency has long promised, but has so far largely failed to deliver. Unlike other digital coins, however, Libra's main barrier to success won't be its technology, but its image.The privacy concerns associated with Facebook, along with the general skepticism associated with notoriously volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are hardly relevant to Libra's platform and functionality. But that won't erase regulators' prejudices. Libra's ability to enamor and educate already highly skeptical and generally misinformed legislators around the world — and in particular, in the West — will mean the difference between joining the ranks of global currencies or sharing the same fate of other high-profile cryptocurrency busts that have come before it.The meager size of the current market for cryptocurrency-based payment and transaction platforms, combined with the relative newness and complexity of the technology, has yielded an immature regulatory environment. As a high-profile entrant, Facebook's new Libra is in a unique position to work with governments to shape legislative roadmaps for cryptocurrency offerings. But the social media company's negative reputation risks leaving the industry with excessively harsh regulations around the world.New cryptocurrencies are almost always compared to Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency that launched in 2009. And Libra is no exception. Each coin, perhaps to both their detriment, will likely always be linked. In reality, however, Libra has an entirely different structure and thus requires different regulations. First, Libra will be an equity-backed asset. This paradigm is getting somewhat more popular in the cryptocurrency space, as evidenced by the growing number of coins backed by precious metals. By being backed by conventional goods, such coins — known commonly as \"stablecoins\" — minimize the volatility often seen in unbacked cryptocurrencies (which currently dominate the market).Unlike Bitcoin, Libra's blockchain will also be run by a corporate umbrella composed of payment processors, tech and telecommunication companies, venture capitalists, nonprofits and other cryptocurrency companies known as the \"Libra Association.\" These companies will not only manage Libra but will also receive payouts upon the initial coin offering (ICO) and earn interest on its equity basket. But perhaps most importantly, the association will govern who can and cannot interact with Libra's blockchain — creating what's called a \"permissioned\" network.A centralized membership body lends tremendous credibility to Libra's ability to control who is using the currency and how within the present financial frameworks. Bitcoin's blockchain, by contrast, is considered \"permissionless,\" which means there is no approval process to \"mine\" for the coin and manage its ledger. As a result, Bitcoin's public infrastructure is notoriously slow and inefficient because of the sheer number of people who are allowed to operate on its system at any given time, which increases the computational power needed to complete transactions. In essence, Libra is trading the conventional conception of cryptocurrencies for increased dependency, function and security, all of which on paper should create a far more accommodating regulatory environment.Libra has a strong interest in working with governing bodies, expressed both in its white papers and Facebook's decision to announce its currency without an actual product. Its success, hinges on ubiquitous acceptance. Ensuring that the proper systems are in place in key markets will thus be paramount to quickly secure the type of global traction needed upon its launch. While most punditry around the currency will be fixated on regulating privacy or its blockchain in general, Libra's exploitable points will be more standard financial measures. Simple regulations — namely, wallet or vendor restrictions, spending limits or international fees — could quickly sink the currency's hopes of joining and eventually disrupting the global economy.Europe: Widespread adoption in Europe will be critical to Libra's long-term success there. To become a viable currency, the coins need to mimic the euro in that they cannot be immediately rendered useless upon entering another country.Switzerland: Given their relatively small economic size and openness toward cryptocurrency, Switzerland is unlikely to restrict Libra's growth. The Libra Association will be headquartered in Geneva, which is fitting as Switzerland is one of the few countries that has passed coherent legislation for coin offerings. Under its current framework, Libra will most likely be regulated as both a payment token and a security token in Switzerland — placing it under the purview of the country's anti-money laundering and banking security requirements. Such regulations will not overly hamper Libra's use case and may, in fact, offer a regulatory blueprint for other countries. Thus, Switzerland will likely provide a welcome regulatory reprieve and home base in what is sure to be an otherwise tricky continent to navigate.The EU: The European Union will certainly be involved in the political aspect of Libra because of its interest in setting standards for the Continent's emerging tech regulations. That said, the bloc has yet to pass any specific cryptocurrency legislation. Supervisory authorities have issued joint warnings, but have taken little concerted action beyond money laundering directives. This is most likely the result of cryptocurrency's clumsy fit within EU regulations. Resting somewhere between a currency, a commodity and a derivative, cryptocurrencies could fall within the confines of monetary policy at the EU level, or as fiscal and economic policy on the national level. An EU-wide decision on cryptocurrency would also require the approval of the bloc's 28 member states — an unlikely proposition on a generally low priority subject.Germany: Specific regulation toward Libra is thus much more apt to occur on a state-by-state basis, which will likely make Germany the most important European market to win over. Home to Europe's largest economy, Germany wields tremendous influence in Brussels and often speaks on behalf of the entire European Union. But Berlin is also a staunch skeptic of U.S. tech companies — including Facebook — which may not bode well for Libra's adoption in the country and thus other EU members.Unlike other cryptocurrencies, the main barrier to Libra's success won't be its technology, but its image.  The U.K.: The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency-related technology, and was the earliest European adopter of PayPal's online payment system (which, at the time, was revolutionary in its own right). The government's relatively new cryptocurrency taskforce has named digital coins as a potentially disruptive field, but one still far too small to regulate. Until the U.K. cryptocurrency market grows to a size London deems worthy of oversight, the Financial Conduct Authority (the country's regulatory body) has been tasked with simply promoting general safety and prudence over cryptocurrencies, instead of imposing strict rules.Such a lax regulatory environment could make the United Kingdom Libra's biggest ally. However, the country's past three years of political crisis surrounding Brexit has largely diminished its trendsetting influence. Libra's success in the country would nonetheless be considered a victory. But London's adoption of the technology is less likely to prompt its neighbors to follow suit — making it much less strategically important market to secure for the coin's European longevity.Developing Countries: One of Libra's key use cases is providing a new and stable currency in under-banked areas of the world. Thus, while less influential in deciphering the global regulatory environment, developing countries will still be critical in securing the currency's long-term adoption.India: India currently has the highest proportion of Facebook users in the world. And indeed, securing high usage rates and normative backing in such a massive market could catapult Libra's proliferation elsewhere. But capturing the imagination of the hundreds of millions of Indian users needed to do so will be easier said than done. In addition to having some of the most active measures against illicit use of virtual currency, India's central bank has banned regulated banks from trading in cryptocurrency. On top of New Delhi's cryptocurrency-adverse regulatory environment, the country's limited tech infrastructure further limits its prospects as a launching ground for Libra. According to a 2017 World Bank survey, the vast majority (70 percent) of Indians still don't own smartphones — meaning only 30 percent of the country even has access to the mobile payment technology needed to use Libra. In other words, before Libra can revolutionize India's currency system, a similar revolution in mobile finance would need to take shape first.Brazil: When it comes to other emerging markets, Brazil is likely the next best bet for Libra's widespread adoption. Yet compared with New Delhi, the South American country offers roughly one billion fewer potential users.The United States: But while Libra is not explicitly billed for the Western world, it cannot exist without its approval. Like any other commodity, the coin stands no chance of survival if it can't be traded for dollars or euros. Given the mix of legislative weakness and cryptocurrency-animosity in emerging markets like Brazil and India, Libra's future will largely hinge on its ability to win over the West — and in particular, the United States.Although the European Union may be equally loud in terms of its political messaging around digital coins, the United States is far more equipped to deal with cryptocurrencies on a legal level. Washington is armed with arguably the world's most comprehensive regulatory framework, which revolves around the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC). But the overlap in authority among these three entities has led to more incoherence than coordination, evidenced by the fact that only one coin has so far jumped through all the hoops needed to register with the SEC.At this point, Libra may be just as likely to carry the cryptocurrency market as it is to destroy it.According to statements released by the legislative and executive branches, Libra actually satisfies the majority of U.S. concerns. Its consortium construction limits security and identification issues, while privacy will naturally be less of a concern within a blockchain than with Facebook's social media platform. Libra's ability to communicate these intricacies, however, will be its true test. The spate of controversies that have shrouded the social media company in recent years has tainted its reputation among Americans and U.S. legislators alike. Shortly after the Libra announcement, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown declared it \"delusional\" that users would trust Facebook with their money. It is thus reasonable to assume that this scrutiny over Libra's parent company — compounded by a general misunderstanding of its differences from Bitcoin — will create a hostile environment. And thanks to Facebook's entrance, the cryptocurrencies that have so far benefitted from the relative lack of oversight may also now face undue attention. Indeed, at this point, Libra may be just as likely to carry the cryptocurrency market as it is to destroy it.Copyright © Stratfor Enterprises, LLC.

      "<title>Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency: A threat to national economies? | USA | Al Jazeera</title>\n",
      "Most Searched10 Aug 2019 10:53 GMT Business & Economy, United States, China, Facebook, CryptoWith the likes of Amazon, Google's parent company Alphabet and Facebook becoming the world's most valuable listed companies, Big Data is quickly becoming the world's most important commodity. Meanwhile, regulators are scrambling to keep up with the changing environment.The newest tech initiative - and one causing some concern - is Facebook's plan to introduce a new digital currency, Libra.A cryptocurrency used by the social network's two billion users could effectively create a new world currency, perhaps even rivalling the dollar, yuan or euro.However, given that Facebook has in the past abused data it has on billions of people, many in policy circles are opposing the cryptocurrency on the grounds that it is also a threat to national economies.The loss of sovereignty is a huge concern for the likes of France's finance minister who raised concerns about a cryptocurrency with huge amounts of power but no governing rules or obligations. Issues of money laundering and funding of terrorism are also concerns for the US treasury secretary.Although Facebook claims its influence on the Libra currency will be limited, tapping into the global payments market will make it extremely rich.\"Libra is going to be the first major cryptocurrency ... introduced by one major corporate or enterprise,\" says Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at Think Markets, comparing it to something like Bitcoin, which he says is decentralised and driven by the user community.\"Innovation is always important for our ecosystem. It always helps to make things more efficient, so yes it is of significant importance that we should see these innovative ideas, these new innovative technologies and currencies emerging,\" he tells Counting the Cost.\"But there shouldn't be a wild wild west when it comes to them. They should adhere to some regulation and make the entire regulatory framework even more better,\" he adds.There is a new battleground in the intensifying trade war between the world's two largest economies, China and the United States: currency valuation.After China's government eased control over the yuan, allowing the currency to surpass the 7 per US dollar mark, the US responded by designating China a currency manipulator.The downside for Chinese consumers is that they will pay more for imports. But with the yuan worth less, Chinese exports become cheaper and are able to compete better in the US and across the world - offsetting the US tariffs imposed on Chinese imports.\"China is trying to say we are not going to be bullied by the US, and a small reminder to the escalation of the trade war and what China can do,\" says Dan Wang, from the Economist Intelligence Unit. But, she adds that a further escalation is \"highly unlikely\".Labelling China a currency manipulator is \"more of a political statement\" by the US, says Viraj Patel, an FX and global macro strategist with Arkera. But he is concerned that the US is willing to \"bend the rules\" to make that statement.\"It's more nuanced than just labelling a country of China's size a currency manipulator,\" he says. \"I think the US has to take a step back ... The approach from the US is completely wrong. As soon as you apply tariffs, as soon as you take more of an aggressive stance on China, they become defensive.\"Patel says the continuation and escalation of the trade \"war\" between the two powers could be quite damaging. \"At some point, someone has to yield, but there is just no end in sight here,\" he says.Source:Â Al Jazeera\n",

      "<title>Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency is part of a disturbing financial trend - The Washington Post</title>\n",
      " Perspective  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  In June, Facebook announced plans to effectively create its own currency, called Libra — and eventually a financial system to go with it. Libra was, of course, cloaked in corporate-speak that promised lower costs and more freedom for consumers and businesses through “innovation” or “inclusion” or “scalability.” But the hubris, from a company with such a mottled record complying with privacy, data and other laws, was so galling that it sparked something rare these days: bipartisan condemnation.What should really concern critics, though, is that Libra is a small part of a larger, more troubling trend: the blurring line between finance and commerce. This trend, now a few decades old, has significant implications for customer privacy, competition, financial risk, and concentrated economic and political power. Stopping Libra would be a sign that policymakers are starting to take these issues seriously, but unwinding the threat of the industry-finance colossus will be much harder.In his 1936 message to Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt warned of the risks from “domination of government by financial and industrial groups, numerically small but politically dominant.” With such concerns in mind, our nation has held that it’s critical to separate banking from commercial business — even enshrining this principle in policy. In practice, however, legal loopholes created by lawyers and lobbyists let financial and commercial companies combine under the same corporate structure.First, industrial companies opened their own banks because, as the robber Willie Sutton once put it, “That’s where the money is.” These “industrial loan” companies are state-chartered banks owned by nonfinancial corporations like Harley-Davidson and Target to make loans, offer credit cards or process transactions. They are allowed to take customer deposits without the same oversight that applies to most banks. For example, their nonfinancial parent companies are not subject to oversight by a banking agency, regulators have fewer tools to address solvency issues, and these banks have fewer restrictions on their activities in the event that they fail to serve the credit needs of their communities. It’s an attractive proposition because deposits are a cheap source of funding, government-provided deposit insurance covers losses up to a certain amount, and retailers are able to drum up business by financing customer purchases.[You didn't need a new Wells Fargo account. I sold you one anyway.]Industrial loan companies were a sleepy part of the financial marketplace until big retailers like Walmart and Home Depot saw an opportunity and applied to open their own banks, in the face of opposition from community banks, consumer groups and labor unions. In the lead-up to the financial crisis, giant commercial lenders GMAC and GE Capital used their banks to access cheap deposits to fund some of their risky activities, like packaging securities backed by risky mortgages, leading to billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts.Unfortunately, instead of eliminating this loophole, the 2010 Wall Street reform law called only for a three-year pause to study industrial bank charters. While there were no industrial charter applications from 2011 to 2016, Big Tech is now looking to come through the door that Congress left open, and regulators in the Trump administration have signaled willingness to entertain their applications. So far, these applications have largely been limited to firms that already offer financial services, such as the $28 billion payment company Square. But companies like Facebook and Amazon probably aren’t far behind. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)Meanwhile, the 1999 law that repealed the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act also allowed banks to own and operate commercial businesses. In congressional testimony, a JPMorgan executive argued that becoming a diversified financial holding company would allow it to offer new conveniences such as opening an in-house travel agency to serve its credit card customers.It’s one thing for a bank to make a loan to, or hold publicly traded shares in, a company with millions of shareholders. But things get more treacherous when a bank is the owner and operator of a company that gives it special insights, market advantages, and the ability to influence nonfinancial businesses in a way that benefits its own financial positions but costs everyone else. For example, a bank that owns an oil terminal could give its commodity traders special insights on regional oil supplies or even seek to control the flow of oil, depending upon its bets in the oil futures markets. That is why banks are supposed to keep the businesses they own at arm’s length through financial and management firewalls, such as limits on the amount of capital a bank can commit to these businesses and prohibitions against involvement in day-to-day operations.But investigations in 2013 and 2014 by two Senate committees revealed that banks were regularly exceeding legal limits on ownership and control. Businesses that rely on aluminum, for instance, reported that a metals warehouse owned by Goldman Sachs was driving up the cost of that commodity, raising the price of products such as canned beer and soda. JPMorgan used its energy trading business to manipulate energy markets, making consumers pay higher electricity rates. After these scandals, regulators promised reforms, but five years later, they have done nothing.This is the real threat of Libra. Facebook could eventually open its own bank and provide a full suite of credit and payment services. Under that arrangement, it could offer favorable credit terms and faster transactions to customers who use its banking services at affiliated retailers. Conversely, Citigroup could open an online retailer, offering lower prices to its bank customers. Either of these scenarios would spell trouble for small banks and retailers forced to compete on an unlevel playing field against big businesses with outsize market power.Then there’s the question of privacy. Commingling a digital marketplace with all of a customer’s financial information, including purchases and deposits, is bad for consumers and taxpayers. First, it centralizes sensitive information — contradicting the supposed purpose of decentralized cryptocurrencies — giving banks and tech companies the ability to mine customers’ data and determine the maximum price that each is willing or able to pay. Second, concentrating so much customer information in a single entity also makes it extra vulnerable to data breaches and abuse. Third, combining a merchant with banking, payment and credit services has the potential to undermine important consumer protections, including credit reporting, debt collection and wage garnishment, giving a single company powerful leverage over its customers by reporting negative information about them, denying their transactions, accessing their bank account funds and so on.[Your health records are supposed to be private. They aren't.]Finally, allowing nonfinancial businesses access to the federal financial support programs that backstop our banking system could lead to taxpayer-funded bailouts for troubled retailers, tech companies and others. There are supposed to be firewalls preventing this, but those contain holes of their own.Consider how all of this is already playing out: The largest Japanese online marketplace, Rakuten, has applied for a U.S. industrial loan company charter, prompting the banking industry’s largest trade association to raise concerns about “the free flow of credit, consumer privacy and possible conflicts of interest.” Walmart recently filed a patent application to create its own cryptocurrency, and Amazon is targeting its less-creditworthy customers with a subprime credit card, which has higher rates, that can be used only on its platforms.Louis Brandeis said of the early-20th-century trusts that “both the financial concentration and the combinations which they have served were, in the main, against the public interest.” Big banks and big tech may rely on fancy algorithms and apps instead of railroads, but his words are just as true today.Regardless of whether Facebook backs away from its proposal voluntarily or is forced to do so, public officials need to send a clear message that any other companies contemplating a similar scheme should think again. It wasn’t the first company to have this idea, and it surely won’t be the last.\n"

      "                The Facebook data breach that affected almost 30 million users last month was different from other recent data breaches in a way that concerns security and privacy experts—and should worry consumers, as well.\n",
      "It’s not just the sheer size that made the Facebook attack notable. Massive incidents such as the Equifax breach from last September were bigger. What's unusual is the kind of data exposed.\"It turns out the Facebook attack was worse than we thought—the fact that very sensitive data was exfiltrated from about 15 million users is staggering,\" says Justin Brookman, director of privacy and technology policy for Consumers Union, the policy and mobilization division of Consumer Reports.The stolen data included religion, gender, relationship status, birthdate, location, and recent search search history for 14 million victims of the attack, Facebook says. An additional 15 million users had just their names and contact information stolen.\"To put this in perspective, can you imagine having access to the personal data of the entire population of New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles?\" asks Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a public-interest research group. \"That's about how many people lost personal information in this breach.\"And while that information might seem almost trivial, according to security experts it’s not as benign as one might imagine. In fact, in some ways, these personal details may be even more consequential than the loss of a Social Security or credit card number.“Most data breaches involve financial information, but your Facebook account can be misused in a number of ways that are harmful,” Brookman says. “Accessing your private communications and posts by itself is pretty invasive, but that information could also be used to crack account security questions or to scam you and your friends.”In the past, services that handle financial transactions and sensitive information generally asked you for a Social Security or driver’s license number to confirm your identity, says Dan Guido, founder of the cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits. “But it’s no longer possible to accurately identify people using those trust markers.”In today’s digital world, that information is hard to safeguard—and it may have been compromised in previous data breaches. So banks and other services have moved toward using personal data—mother’s maiden name, pets’ names, the street you grew up on—to protect important accounts.With some sleuthing, a determined cybercriminal might uncover some of these personal details on a Facebook page, assuming you leave your page open to public view in your privacy settings. But this breach delivered that data directly, giving hackers a head start for potential identity theft crimes.Criminals could also use such data to build robust bios that become powerful weapons in phishing scams, where personalized emails trick consumers into revealing financial information or clicking on links that plant malware on their computers.When a cybercriminal knows the haunts and hobbies of a potential victim—the kind of information collected about millions of the victims of the Facebook attack—it dramatically increases their odds of success.“If they know specific things—my mom’s name, my kids’ names, their birthdates—they could easily look legitimate,” says Sam McLane, chief technology services officer at the cybersecurity firm Arctic Wolf Networks. Imagine a scenario where a thief pretends to be calling from a bank, using photos or location data from a social media account to obtain valuable account information. “They call and say, ‘This is Chase, and we notice that you went to Bob’s House of Tacos last Thursday,’” he says. “Suddenly, it makes it believable enough that I suspend my suspicions.”The thing that could make Facebook data extra-valuable to criminals, says Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is its accuracy. After all, it was entered into Facebook's computer systems by consumers themselves.In contrast, personal details stolen in data breaches of retailers or data brokerages can be off-base, since it has been inferred from consumer behavior.The Facebook data could also end up being used in ransomware or blackmailing attacks, warns Casey Oppenheim, founder of the data security firm Disconnect. “People do a lot of very personal things on Facebook,” he says. “They talk about things they wouldn’t want their employer or their spouse to know. Hackers can do nasty stuff with that.”In the end, personally identifiable data will endure in a way that financial information may not. You can—and should—change passwords after a breach. Go ahead and cancel a credit card. You can even get a new Social Security number if your first one is stolen.But the telling details on your Facebook account—your birthdate, where you were born, your first pet’s name—that is forever. “Digital data is like a genie in a bottle,” Oppenheim says. “Once it gets out of the bottle, it’s extremely difficult—if not impossible—to get it back in.”\"It's definitely worthwhile to see what information of yours was accessed as a result of this breach by following this Facebook link,\" CR's Brookman says.\n",
      "More broadly, this is a good time to rethink what you post on social media. “Just because Facebook wants your hometown, your gender, and your birthdate, you don’t have to give it to them,” the World Privacy Forum's Dixon says.One important step is to simply, well, lie. When you’re setting up an account, you don’t have to tell the whole truth. Who’s to know (besides you and a few close friends) if you substitute the date of your anniversary—or the publication date of the novel \"1984\"—for your birthday? The dozens of acquaintances who offer you birthday wishes every year will be none the wiser.\n",
      "“Don’t put anything on Facebook that you wouldn’t want public,” Guido, of Trail of Bits, says.And when answering those pesky account security questions, you can give an answer that’s not quite accurate but remains easy for you to remember. Maybe tell your bank that you were born in Green Bay (where your favorite team plays) rather than Sarasota, where you were actually born. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brookman adds that an attack like this this should encourage consumers to adopt security best practices such as two-factor authentication, strong, unique passphrases, and credit freezes.Finally, be skeptical of unexpected queries, even if they sound legit. If you get a phone call from a financial institution that raises your suspicions, call back using a number you find on your bank statement or the back of your credit card. If you get a suspicious-looking email, don’t open it. Just delete it.Here are some additional ways to keep yourself safe from a phishing attack:\n",
      "Examine the link. Before you click on a link, try hovering your mouse over it. This will reveal the full address, which can expose signs of fraud. An “.ru” on the end, for example, means the site was created in Russia; “.br” means Brazil.Misspellings are another good tip-off to a fake website. If the URL reads “bankoffamerica.com,” it’s trouble. Better yet, don't click on any link in an unsolicited email, or call any phone number. Just open a new browser window and go directly to the business's website.Finally, if don’t assume that a website is legitimate just because its URL starts with “https.” Encryption is available to everyone.Don’t open attachments. They may contain malware. And you should never type confidential information into a form attached to an email. The sender may be able to read the info you enter.Guard your financial information. Be especially wary of emails asking for account numbers, credit card numbers, and wire transfer information. There’s no reason to share such info via message or a nonsecure site.\n",
      "Turn on auto updates. This goes for computers, smartphones, and tablets. Up-to-date security software goes a long way toward stopping malware.Use security tools. Install an antivirus program on your device and keep it up to date. You can also use a website reputation rating tool, which comes in the form of a browser plug-in, to warn you if you try to go to potentially dangerous websites.\n",
      "                    We respect your privacy.\n",

      "<title>Facebook will pay $5 billion fine for Cambridge Analytica data breaches</title>\n",
      "The Federal Trade Commission has announced that Facebook will pay a massive fine in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The social network will pay $5 billion to settle the charge that it broke a 2012 FTC order concerning the privacy of user data. And, as part of the settlement, Facebook has had to agree to a new management structure and new rules about how it manages user data.Facebook, now subject to a 20-year settlement order, will have to create a new independent privacy committee. A group of Facebook directors will meet, every quarter, to receive reports from an independent privacy \"assessor,\" who will monitor Facebook's actions. The FTC has also put in place rules to prevent CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has majority control of the company, from single-handedly dismissing them.The social network (including WhatsApp and Instagram) will also be bound by new reporting rules on disclosing privacy breaches to authorities. Should personal information affecting more than 500 users be leaked, Facebook will have 30 days to notify the FTC. Facebook was criticized after using phone numbers, supplied to enable two-factor authentication, for advertising purposes. As part of the settlement, it will no longer be able to do so.Absolute insanity that CEO Zuckerberg was able to avoid being questioned by FTC and Parliaments (despite subpoena) and has avoided answering simple questions on who knew what/when around Cambridge Analytica scandal. Our institutions should be embarrassed. https://t.co/l5bIBakINnThe $5 billion figure was agreed upon back in early July, and was widely-reported at the time, although the figure was seen as far too small. Recode founder Kara Swisher wrote in the New York Times that $5 billion was \"A parking ticket,\" and that the FTC should \"put another zero\" on the fine. Investors, similarly, seemed happy that the fine was survivable, and Facebook's stock price rose after the reports filtered out.The FTC voted along party lines to bring the suit, with the two Democrats voting no as they felt the FTC didn't go far enough. Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter said that the FTC was \"more than justified\" in bringing a lawsuit against Facebook for its numerous privacy failures. Slaughter feels, however, that the fine was \"insufficient,\" and that the new rules imposed will not have the desired outcome. The fact that Facebook avoided litigation, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was not held accountable for any of this, were other objections Slaughter held.At the same time, the FTC has also doled out punishments for two key figures within Cambridge Analytica. Alexandr Kogan (who developed the infamous personality test app), and Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nic have both agreed to restrictions on their future business conduct.That includes an order to delete, or destroy, any remaining personal information they hold as part of their work for CA. And, in future, both Kogan and Nix will be barred from making false or deceptive claims regarding their use of personal data, and the sale of it.The SEC, too, has fined Facebook $100 million for misleading investors about its data security. Officials said that the social network said that data breaches were hypothetical, despite the fact one had already taken place. The fact that Facebook \"knew that a third-party developer had actually misused Facebook user data,\" was a failure to disclose.In a statement, SEC officials say that Facebook knew about Cambridge Analytica's breaches in 2015, but didn't disclose until 2017. The SEC's Erin E. Schneider says that Facebook also \"misled reporters, who asked the company about its investigation into Cambridge Analytica.\" In that instance, Facebook has agreed to pay the fine but without \"admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.\"Facebook has published its own response, by general counsel Colin Stretch, which says that the settlement will \"require a fundamental shift in the way\" it approaches its work. Stretch says that Facebook's handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal was \"a breach of trust\" between the company and its users.Stretch also admits, several paragraphs in, that, just this month, \"shortcomings\" in its systems allowed some partners to continue accessing data they should not have had access to. Essentially, that even after all of this, Facebook has still struggled to get a grip on the vulnerabilities in its system.And Mark Zuckerberg posted a status -- the FTC opted not to interview him as part of its investigation -- agreeing with Stretch's points. The CEO said that he will appoint a Chief Privacy Officer, and that \"more than a thousand people across our company\" will be tasked with identifying and limiting privacy risks.\n",
      "<title>Facebook's Data-Privacy Scandals Will Come at a Hefty Price | Vanity Fair</title>\n",
      "Already a subscriber? Sign InNo Articles leftSign InAlready a subscriber?Sign InCreate An AccountThe company will likely face a multi-billion-dollar F.T.C. penalty—and potentially new terms that involve Zuckerberg himself.Facebook is preparing to face the consequences of its recent data-privacy scandals. In an earnings report released Wednesday, the company estimated that it will pay anywhere from $3 billion to $5 billion in fees to the Federal Trade Commission, which has been conducting an inquiry into its data-privacy practices. “The matter remains unresolved, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome,” the company noted about the inquiry, which would mark Facebook’s first consequence in the U.S. from the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The earnings report followed earlier rumors that the F.T.C. was preparing to levy a fine on Facebook, after Cambridge Analytica sparked concerns that the company had violated a 2011 F.T.C. agreement. That agreement demands Facebook have a “comprehensive privacy program,” and get the “express consent” of its users before sharing their data. Though $3 billion is still a small portion of Facebook’s overall cash haul—the company reported over $15 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019 alone—the move would allow the F.T.C. to flex its muscles against Facebook in the wake of its highly publicized scandals. A multi-billion-dollar fine would mark the F.T.C.’s biggest penalty against a tech company for breaking a data-privacy agreement, beating out a previous $22.5 million penalty paid by Google in 2012. “Facebook faces a moment of reckoning, and the only way it will come is through an F.T.C. order with severe penalties and other sanctions that stop this kind of privacy misconduct going forward,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said in February.Though the details of any potential settlement—including any new terms for Facebook to follow—aren’t yet known, the deal could potentially involve Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg himself. Recent reports have suggested that federal regulators are determining how to hold Zuckerberg personally responsible for the company’s privacy failings, considering the Facebook C.E.O. and co-founder also holds the distinction of being its board chairman and majority shareholder. The idea has gained traction in Congress, with Sen. Ron Wyden writing in a letter to the F.T.C. that the agency should hold Zuckerberg “individually liable for the company’s repeated violations of Americans’ privacy.”Facebook’s confirmation of its impending F.T.C. fine comes as user-privacy concerns over Facebook continue to mount: NBC News reported April 18 on internal Facebook documents from 2011 to 2015 that detailed how the company used user data as a “bargaining chip,” and the company admitted last week to storing millions of Instagram-user passwords in plain text. The F.T.C. also isn’t Facebook’s only governmental woe, as the company faces investigations from state attorneys general, federal agencies such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and foreign governments, including a potential $1.63 billion fine from the European Union.The company has been staffing up in response, hiring both a former anti-trust head at the Department of Justice and a Trump appointee who helped draft the Patriot Act for the company’s general counsel. Still, as Facebook builds their ”privacy-focused vision for the future of social networking,” as Zuckerberg said in a statement Wednesday, the F.T.C. fine is likely a signal that a bigger moment of regulatory reckoning for the company lies ahead. “Facebook’s handling of personal data, and its use for political campaigns, are prime and legitimate areas for inspection by regulators,” members of the British Parliament wrote in a report released in February. “We must make sure that people stay in charge of the machines.”— Cover story: Nicole Kidman reflects on her career, marriage, faith, and texting with Meryl Streep— The investigations that could haunt Trump— A mega-church pastor’s drug-running hustle— Elizabeth Warren’s new approach: courting Game of Thrones fans?— Why L.A. is ground zero for the next tech apocalypseLooking for more?

      "    Buzz60Facebook defended itself against an accusation printed by The New York Times, claiming the social network released private data to other large tech companies without the knowledge of the users.(Photo: Derzsi Elekes Andor / Wikimedia Commons)Another day, another Facebook privacy scandal. The latest worrying report: According to The New York Times Facebook gave technology companies like Microsoft, Netflix and Spotify special access to user's data without anyone else knowing.The revelation is the latest in a string of bad news for Facebook. In just the last couple of months the company has suffered multiple outages, a reveal that it considered selling user data after pledging not to, and a bug that affected 6.8 million people giving permission to third-party apps to access their photos.And this doesn’t include the testimonies on Capitol Hill and other scandals that the company has faced this year. Now on Wednesday, the attorney general for the District of Columbia has filed a suit against Facebook for permitting political consultancy Cambridge Analytica access to the personal data of tens of millions of users without their permission, according to Washington Post sources.So here's what we know now from the new report. According to the Times, Facebook gave big companies greater access to its users' data without the user's permission. This includes giving Microsoft's search engine Bing access to see all of a user's friends without the user's consent, letting Netflix and Spotify read a user's private messages and allowing Amazon to gather names and contact information. The Times also reports that Facebook was still sharing \"streams of friends' posts\" with Yahoo \"as recently as this summer\" even though the Facebook claiming publicly to have stopped the practice years ago. More: Facebook denies giving Spotify, Netflix, other tech giants wider access to data without user permissionKonstantinos Papamiltiadis, the company's director of developer platforms and programs, denied that Facebook gave companies user data without the user's permission. \"To be clear: none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people’s permission,\" Papamiltiadis wrote on Facebook, adding that the company similarly did not \"violate our 2012 settlement with the FTC.\"In 2012, the Federal Trade Commision settled with Facebook over claims the social network \"deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.\"As part of the settlement, the FTC required Facebook give users \"clear and prominent notice and obtaining their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings,\" as well as keep \"a comprehensive privacy program to protect consumers' information.\" The Commission also said Facebook would need \"biennial privacy audits from an independent third party\" to make sure it is properly protecting user information.Papamiltiadis does acknowledge that these companies and others have had access to Facebook user information, but users need to opt-in to utilize their Facebook account on a third-party platform, like Spotify, Netflix or Bing.  Facebook, like other social networks and platforms, allows developers to connect to its service using tools known as APIs. The goal: to allow people to connect with their Facebook friends without having to leave the other app.These are the pop-ups you see after you click on a \"connect to Facebook\" or \"sign in with Facebook\" button letting you log in to Facebook and telling you what information of yours is being shared and what parts of your Facebook the company you're connecting with will have access to. Spotify asking you to \"connect to Facebook\" on its desktop app. (Photo: Screenshot)For Spotify, Papamiltiadis notes, after you've signed in to Facebook on the Spotify desktop app, \"you could then send and receive messages without ever leaving the app.\"Since this API was designed to use Facebook's messaging feature, \"our API provided partners with access to the person’s messages in order to power this type of feature.\" Papamiltiadis says the company is currently \"in the midst of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them.\" Well, no. While this integration between companies and services is common all across the tech industry, the Times report says that Facebook gave the aforementioned big companies, as well as others like the Royal Bank of Canada, more detailed data than it had previously disclosed and without user knowledge. All as part of an effort designed to grow Facebook's user base and generate more advertising dollars.For better or worse, most people skip reading the terms of services very carefully. Facebook's terms of service allow it to collect a wide range of information about you. From basic personal information like your name, age and birthdate to the type of phone you used, the websites you visited, things you are interested in and the location you are logging on from.While you can limit some of these by adjusting privacy settings, when you agree to use Facebook you agree to let it collect this data. Facebook's terms say it gathers all of this data to help it provide \"Facebook Products,\" which include the Facebook mobile app and in-app browser, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. It says it doesn't \"sell any individual data that could identify you, like your name,\" instead grouping people into more generalized categories based on the information collected and the market the advertiser wants to reach.   A few of the companies named in the report have already spoken out.Microsoft, Amazon and Yahoo told the Times any data they accessed was used appropriately. Netflix replied to the Times on Twitter that it \"never asked for, or accessed, anyone's private messages.\" Netflix never asked for, or accessed, anyone's private messages. We're not the type to slide into your DMs.Legislators from both sides of the aisle have shared their thoughts on this latest revelation, with calls growing for Congress to regulate the social network. \"It is beyond obvious at this point that social media platforms are simply not up to the task of voluntarily ensuring the privacy and security of their users,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote. \"Congress must step in.\"It is beyond obvious at this point that social media platforms are simply not up to the task of voluntarily ensuring the privacy and security of their users. Congress must step in. https://t.co/xNQSWtxUps\"We cannot grow numb to Facebook’s continued violations of user’s privacy,\" wrote Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mi., adding that \"Congress must enact legislation to protect Americans’ sensitive information.\"We cannot grow numb to Facebook’s continued violations of user’s privacy. This @NYTimes report is another signal that Congress must enact legislation to protect Americans’ sensitive information. https://t.co/VN4DkXnw2i“The hits just keep on coming,” GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters at the Capitol Wednesday. “We were told that this won’t happen again. It’s clear that Facebook took people’s private information, including but not limited to their private messages and sold it to other companies for a bucket-load of money. And they’ve been doing that all along and the first time it might have been a mistake but the second time it was a choice and I don’t want to have to regulate Facebook but they’re going to give us no choice here.”“Mr. Zuckerberg is a very smart man, he could spot me 75 IQ points but the way he’s acting he’s got no sense and this is unacceptable,” Kennedy is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee which Zuckerberg testified in front of earlier this year.More: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg testifies: 6 things we learned, a bunch we didn'tMore: Kennedy to Zuckerberg: 'Your user agreement sucks'When it comes to protecting Facebook data right now, it really is hard to say what you can do given the seemingly monthly (if not weekly) disclosures about how Facebook is handling user data. While deleting your Facebook account is certainly an option, given the prevalence of not just the main Facebook product but also WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger, for many dropping the company isn't feasible.This latest episode should, however, serve as yet another reminder to be careful, and perhaps think twice, about what you share online. While companies say they will protect your data, as Facebook's 2018 has shown these \"protections\" only go so far. Contributing: Eliza CollinsFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n"

      "<title>Facebook Privacy Update: Mark Zuckerberg's Response To Cambridge Analytica Scandal One Year On</title>\n",
      "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears on a television screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as he testifies in the Senate in Washington.(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)As fresh allegations of an executive-level cover up at Facebook regarding who knew what and when emerge, the one year anniversary of the Cambridge Analytica scandal when investigative journalists revealed the company had been harvesting personal data from 87 million Facebook profiles for political campaigning purposes has arrived. This comes a day after the academic, Aleksandr Kogan, whose quiz app was central to the allegations of data hoovering, sued the social network for defamation. All of which leaves me wondering what, if anything, Mark Zuckerberg has learned from this, the most turbulent year in the history of Facebook?Facebook was engulfed in a veritable tidal wave of privacy-driven angst at the time, but that angst didn't turn into any mass user migration away from the social media giant. According to Goldman Sachs the number of users, at least those accessing the service via mobile devices, increased by 7% during the month that the scandal was headline news. This suggests that the lure of Facebook and its central role in connecting friends, family and strangers alike has not suffered greatly in the eyes of the average user. Which isn't to say that Zuckerberg has escaped without criticism as a quick polling of the twitterverse revealed this week. I asked what lessons Mark Zuckerberg might have learned, the suggestions ranged from \"That despite all the lather and bluster, he can still trouser a pile of cash and he can't be touched\" to \"Literally, none. It's that we have learned more about Mark Zuckerberg - and the lengths he will go to to continue Facebook's questionable practices.\" Those opinions would appear apposite given that Facebook shares quickly bounced back to cover the initial $100 billion loss. Regulatory pressure wasn't overly effective either. Sure, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the U.K. fined Facebook £500,000 ($645,000), the maximum amount possible at the time, which is but spare change to a business as big as Facebook. Had Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) been in in play at the time, Facebook could have been fined 4% of its global turnover which would have been around £1.3 billion ($1.8 billion).So, a year on, what has changed both in terms of how 'we, the people' perceive expectations of privacy in the online space and just as importantly what the Facebook view looks like? There's no doubting that data privacy has moved front and center into the awareness of the average online user during these last 12 months. Equally there is little doubt that Facebook is having to move with the times and recognize this increased expectation for more control over who uses our data and for what purpose. Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, insists that he has a 'privacy-focused vision for social networking.' In his blog posting of the same name, Zuckerberg says that \"we've repeatedly shown that we can evolve to build the services that people really want, including in private messaging and stories\" and insists \"the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages.\" Not everyone, myself included, is convinced that merging WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger infrastructures to create a unified messaging platform is the answer to the Facebook privacy problem. \"After the debacle with Facebook selling data to Cambridge Analytics it's only a matter of time that the consolidated data from the world's most popular messaging platforms become the next black gold for Facebook's growth\" says John Safa, founder of protected content sharing platform Pushfor, who adds \"we've created this nightmare by our passion to share everything we do, say or think on these online platforms.\"\n",
      "This seems at odds with Zuckerberg's recent claim that Facebook is an innovator in privacy. \"All of the success that Facebook has had... has been because we've given people new private or semi-private ways to communicate things that they wouldn't have had before\" Zuckerberg says. Derek Roga, CEO of secure mobile communication platform EQUIIS Technologies, argues that Facebook will never be known as a champion of data privacy. \"Without continuing to subtract data from its users\" Roga says \"Facebook would need to change its entire business model which may result in a decline in financial results - a sacrifice I doubt the company will want to make.\" Certainly the recently revealed case of third-party apps feeding personal data back to Facebook even if, in some cases, the user wasn't logged in or didn't have a Facebook account, provides food for thought. It turns out that Roga wasn't all that surprised when this story broke. \"Big players like Facebook have built their ad businesses on audience and user data\" he explains, continuing \"the company proposed a 'clear history tool' in an effort to win user trust again and create transparency, but the delays to this product suggests Facebook still sees value in holding onto personal data.\"Roga's assertion is bolstered by the fact that earlier this week the New York Times reported how federal prosecutors are \"conducting a criminal investigation into data deals Facebook struck with some of the world's largest technology companies.\" Forbes contributor Zak Doffman says \"It is yet more of the same post-Cambridge Analytica - private data being treated as a tradable commodity, with no thought to the implications or ethics of doing so.\" None of which means that Facebook has violated any criminal laws, of course, but according to one report \"there are numerous reasons why Facebook's decision to share users' information with app developers or other outside companies was ill-advised...\" Zuckerberg and Facebook continue to make moves in the right direction to be fair, but it remains to be seen just how committed the social network is to giving users control over their own information as well as providing complete transparency into all data shared with Facebook and how it is used.I approached Facebook for comment on this story, but at the time of publication this had not been forthcoming.I'm a three-decade veteran technology journalist and have been a contributing editor at PC Pro magazine since the first issue in 1994.

But scale is only part of what’s driving that dazzling success: COO Sheryl Sandberg and her team have been relentlessly experimenting with how to make ads more compelling despite the limitations of small screens. “Creativity’s never been so important,” Sandberg says. “When TV ads [first appeared], people thought the creative was important. Then when you moved into online, what really mattered was the targeting. What we’re [now] seeing on the Facebook platform is that it’s both.”Over the past year, Facebook rolled out several new mobile ad formats, including full-screen, 360-degree video, and interactive ads that let users swipe, tilt, and zoom through carousels of images. And to help advertisers experiment with and make sense of these products, in November Facebook debuted the Creative Hub, a platform for businesses and agencies to mock up, share, and test ads. With Facebook’s growing focus on video, it’s also encouraging marketers to adapt their materials specifically to the social network (rather than just repost ready-made TV spots). When Sony Pictures added subtitles to its movie trailers last spring and recut them into a more news feed–friendly square format, it found them five times more effective in raising awareness than standard reposted previews. “You can’t just take your ads that were on the last platform and then port them over to the new one,” Sandberg says.Facebook is also enabling a more direct connection between online engagement and real-world commerce. Already some brands have used targeting to double the revenue yield from news-feed campaigns, such as when Celebrity Cruises showed users trip itineraries based on Facebook’s insights into where they were planning to visit. The next step is letting users complete the transaction without leaving the platform. In October, Facebook turned its Events calendar into a stand-alone app, allowing groups of friends to, say, buy concert tickets through the service, thanks to its relationships with Ticketmaster and Eventbrite. “We’re thinking about how to make Facebook more useful,” says Andrew Bosworth, VP of ads and business platform. “We’ve got 60 million businesses [with official pages] on the platform. We’ve got 1.8 billion people. All we need to do is connect them.”The marriage of social recommendations with commerce is rapidly attracting advertisers: 4 million on Facebook, 500,000 on Instagram. As Sandberg says, “We want to help them move products off shelves and drive cars off lots.”This article is part of our coverage of the World’s Most Innovative Companies of 2017.Fast Company Daily Newsletter\n"

      "<title>Facebook is experimenting with robots to push its AI research forward - The Verge</title>\n",
      "Filed under:But don’t expect to see any Facebook robots on sale Facebook is certainly a high-tech company, but it’s not one you would necessarily associate with robots. However, as the firm revealed today, that’s exactly where its researchers are looking next — trying to see how experiments in robotics can further its work in AI.This isn’t uncommon for big tech companies. A lot of firms, including Google, Nvidia, and Amazon, use robots as a platform to explore avenues of AI research. Controlling robots is, in many ways, trickier than challenges like playing board games and video games. With these latter tasks, researchers have access to simulated game environments, which allows AI agents to play and learn at accelerated speeds. There’s no such shortcut for training robots.“The great thing about robotics is that it takes place in real time, in the real world,” Facebook’s Antoine Bordes, co-managing director of the company’s artificial intelligence research labs, told Bloomberg News. The research is wide-ranging, and Facebook has shared details about a trio of papers. The first involves getting a six-legged robot to teach itself how to walk through trial and error, the second is about leveraging “curiosity” to help robots learn faster, and the third is about using a sense of touch to help a robot achieve simple tasks like rolling a ball. None of these papers are breakthroughs, per se, and the topics being researched are also being addressed elsewhere by universities and labs. But it’s notable, still, that Facebook’s AI research lab (known as FAIR) is pursuing this line of work. The company’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, told Bloomberg that FAIR has a duty to “see around corners” and be prepared for future products and services, including robots. “You’ve got to start early,” said LeCun. “It’s not just something you can jump into when it picks up.”In some small ways, Facebook has already shown that getting to grips with physical systems can have unexpected payoffs. For example, when the company launched its Portal home video chat camera, it worked with filmmakers to design the camera movements that frame users for each shot. Despite widespread privacy concerns surrounding the Portal, reviewers did praise the company for making the calling experience surprisingly seamless. Knowing how to tie together AI and hardware gave Facebook a small leg up with Portal, and it could do so again with future products. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\n",

The work is similar to the (mildly creepy) autonomous robot work going on at Boston Dynamics, but different in that Facebook is opening up its research to everyone in the field, a, Facebook researcher tells Fast Company. That’s why the company just released several research papers describing its work since last summer, when the robotics lab opened.Facebook is trying to develop artificial intelligence models that will allow robots–including walking hexapods, articulated arms, and robotic hands fitted with tactile sensors–to learn by themselves, and to keep getting smarter as they encounter more and more tasks and situations.In the case of the spider-like hexapod (“Daisy”) I saw walking around a patio at Facebook last week, the researchers give a goal to the robot and task the model with figuring out by trial and error how to get there. The goal can be as simple as just moving forward. In order to walk, the spider has to know a lot about its balance, location, and orientation in space. It gathers this information through the sensors on its legs.“As it gathers information, the model optimizes for rewards and improves its performance over time,” say the researchers in a blog post published today.Also, the data coming from the robot’s various sensors in real-world testing can be messy and uncertain, which creates an even bigger challenge for the model. An uneven surface or new wind conditions could knock the thing off course or even cause it to fall over.This way of training a model (learning by doing) is different than the supervised learning other types of machine learning models undergo. For instance, a model designed to identify plants might be trained by showing it thousands of images, correctly labeled, and allowing the model to learn from the similarities between the images. The training data is relatively easy to come by; it’s available at open source sites, for example.Like human babies, the robots start out with almost nothing. They lack an understanding of their environment and how their bodies move within it. That’s one of the reasons Facebook rewards the AI models behind the robots to explore and learn.During my visit to the robotics lab in Menlo Park last week, Facebook research scientist Franziska Meier showed me how she sends a command to a robotic arm. After the arm moved, she told me that it had just received and responded to 300 instructions, not just one. She actually sent instructions on which joints should move, how fast, how much, and in what order, and probably a bunch of other things.Part of the job of the model behind the robotic arm is to learn from itself. “We are sending commands to the joints and modeling the relationship between the commands and the movements of the joints,” Meier told me.Developing this keen understanding of cause and effect (as humans develop when very small) will help the robot complete specific tasks later on. This might include exploring a specific environment and manipulating objects.You might wonder why a social networking company is spending resources on robotics research. The answer is it’s ultimately more about the AI than the robots. “This work will lead to more capable robots, but more important, it will lead to AI that can learn more efficiently and better generalize to new applications,” the researchers said.Technology Newsletter\n",
      "<title>Facebook, boosting artificial-intelligence research, says it’s ‘not going fast enough’ - The Washington Post</title>\n",
      "Facebook will dramatically accelerate its research into artificial intelligence, its chief AI scientist said Tuesday, in hopes of ensuring the social network doesn’t fall behind with the technology it will need to contend with Internet rivals and police its gargantuan audience.The world’s biggest social network said it would recruit high-profile engineers and expand its AI-research division to roughly 170 scientists and engineers across eight global offices, including Paris, Pittsburgh, Montreal, London and Tel Aviv. The expansion of the international labs and new academic partnerships will be devoted to the study of robotics, virtual animation, learning machines and other forms of AI.Yann LeCun, Facebook’s chief AI scientist and an early machine-learning architect, said the expanded research effort was pushed by Facebook leaders such as CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “AI has become so central to the operations of companies like ours, that what our leadership has been telling us is: ‘Go faster. You’re not going fast enough,’ ” LeCun said.Facebook’s international expansion and academic partnerships mimic the model used by many of AI’s biggest corporate players, which gives top researchers and engineers the freedom to teach classes, publish papers and split their time between academic and commercial pursuits.LeCun said Facebook’s AI researchers will focus on the long-term pursuit of “machines that have some level of common sense” and learn “how the world works by observation, like young children do in the first few months of life.”[AI will solve Facebook’s most vexing problems, Mark Zuckerberg says. Just don’t ask when or how.]AI — the sweeping term for systems that train on lots of data, make decisions and improve without overt human control — is one of modern technology’s most competitive fields, with tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft grappling with firms in China and Europe for the top talent, applications and ideas. Google CEO Sundar Pichai in January called AI “one of the most important things that humanity is working on” and “more profound than electricity or fire.”While Facebook’s AI rivals have developed automated voice assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa, or spearheaded breakthroughs in gaming, robotics or self-driving cars, the social network has devoted much of its AI engineering to analysis of images, video and text — facial recognition, language translation and detection of unwanted content or harmful comments. (Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)A typical user can often miss the subtle ways Facebook’s AI influences their actions, including photo tag suggestions, algorithmically decided news feeds, friend recommendations, spam blocking and ad targeting.AI is a critical battlefield for Facebook, with Zuckerberg pledging to Congress and investors that automated tools would help solve some of the company’s thorniest problems, including extremist propaganda, misinformation and hate speech. The company says AI has boosted its ability to monitor the social network’s 2 billion users, but it still relies heavily on human moderators and, as LeCun noted, “works not so well with false news.”[When a stranger takes your face: Facebook’s failed crackdown on fake accounts]The company on Tuesday announced new partnerships in Pittsburgh, Seattle, London and Facebook’s hometown, Menlo Park, Calif., to bring on specialists in developing AI to scour vast image libraries, process varying languages and analyze human motion.Facebook’s global expansion, beginning with labs in Paris and Montreal three years ago, has allowed the company to secure a seat near top universities, research institutes and other “talent factories” where AI researchers and academics are at work.Google recently announced it would open an AI lab in Accra, the capital of Ghana, in hopes of attracting AI talent from across West Africa.[Shake-up at Facebook highlights tension in race for AI]Details of Facebook’s AI research are limited. But LeCun said one lab — in Pittsburgh, known for its Silicon Valley-like “Robotics Row” — will study robots with the goal of further understanding the interplay between humans and machines.The research, LeCun said, could be used to build better virtual assistants, though he said it was unlikely anyone would be chatting with a Facebook robot anytime soon.“It’s too early to talk about consumer applications of robotics, but robots will likely play a role in bringing people together,” he said.\n"

These features can’t work without computers reading the images and recognizing what they contain.

      "But because Facebook is doing it, there’s an obvious question that immediately comes to mind: Is Facebook mining these photos for content that could be used to better target the ads it’s serving to users? Facebook collects a large amount of data from everyone surfing the internet, whether they’re on Facebook or not, so it’s likely safe to assume that the information it reads from user photos could also be easily connected with other user data. That said, Facebook hasn’t confirmed anything at this point.Before you even ask, no, this isn’t something you can opt-out of. Facebook will continue to catalog these images and improve its AI machine learning in the process. What you can do is prevent Facebook from using facial recognition to tag you in photos automatically, which is something you definitely should do so others can’t use the feature against you.Copyright 2019 BGR Media, LLCPMC EntertainmentPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Ad Choices | Privacy Preferences | Terms Of UsePMC Entertainment\n",

The agents' improvement gradually performed through trial and error. But in the past week or so, some media outlets have published reports on the work that are alarmist in tone.  \"Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language,\" London's Telegraph newspaper reported.  \"'Robot intelligence is dangerous': Expert's warning after Facebook AI 'develop their own language,'\" as London's Sun tabloid put it. At times some of the chatter between the agents did deviate from standard correct English. But that wasn't the point of the paper; the point was to make the agents effectively negotiate. The researchers finished their experiment, and indeed they noticed that the agents even figured out how to pretend to be interested in something they didn't actually want,  \"only to later 'compromise' by conceding it,\" Mike Lewis, Denis Yarats, Yann Dauphin, Devi Parikh and Dhruv Batra of Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research group wrote in the paper.On Monday evening Batra weighed in on the situation in a Facebook post:While the idea of AI agents inventing their own language may sound alarming/unexpected to people outside the field, it is a well-established sub-field of AI, with publications dating back decades.Simply put, agents in environments attempting to solve a task will often find unintuitive ways to maximize reward. Analyzing the reward function and changing the parameters of an experiment is NOT the same as  \"unplugging\" or \"shutting down AI.\" If that were the case, every AI researcher has been \"shutting down AI\" every time they kill a job on a machine.Batra called certain media reports  \"clickbaity and irresponsible.\" What's more, the negotiating agents were never used in production; it was simply a research experiment.Other researchers have been critical of the fear-mongering reports on social media in recent days.Researchers at Alphabet and Elon Musk-backed OpenAI are among those who have recently explored the field of agent-to-agent chat -- one of many areas where AI is being applied today -- and at times the agents have developed their own styles of communication, which researchers have been able to subsequently modify.Notably Facebook released the underlying software and data set for its experiment alongside the academic paper.

      "This post covers how Facebook builds and scales AI/ML platforms using the March 2018 Scaled Machine Learning Conference session given by Yangqing Jia, Facebook’s Director of AI Infrastructure (link). I’ll cover the subject at a high level so if you’re one of those pHD-y types already focus on things like hybrid pointer-generator networks, spherical convolutional neural networks or Wasserstein Autoencoders then this may not be for you.Recently a consulting firm reached out to me for advice about building and scaling Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) platforms for their customers. I have some experience in this space at the infrastructure level working with Intel and NVIDIA, and at the software and services level working with Amazon, IBM and a few others so I decided to help them out. This post covers some key focus areas when it comes to scaling AI/ML platforms for their customers. I figure it is best to approach this topic through household names with products and services that most understand and use on a daily basis so I chose Facebook and Uber.For Facebook, I’ll focus on the software and hardware considerations they made to successfully scale AI/ML infrastructure per an excellent talk given by Yangqing Jia, Facebook’s Director of AI Infrastructure, at the Scaled Machine Learning Conference. If you are interested in learning about how Uber successfully built their AI/ML platform, Michelangelo, and organizational changes they’ve made to ensure successfully AI/ML adoption then click here, to continue with Facebook’s AI/ML efforts keep reading. One last note, this discussion focuses on Facebook’s approach so it is given from a non-cloud perspective which changes some of the narrative as public clouds alter your approach, eliminating some options and making other choices significantly easier.Lets start by quickly level setting on the some Machine Learning (ML) definitions by analyzing the Machine Learning Execution Flow.The main components of an ML workflow you need to understand to read further are the following:Now that we’ve level set on terms, lets take a look at infrastructure challenges. Three primary infrastructure challenges you’ll find with building out your AI/ML platform, which are storage, networking and compute.When building out your AI/ML infrastructure, its very difficult to get everything right the first time as you have to process the plethora of compute, networking and storage decisions and come to a solution while your ML use cases and requirements are constantly changing. Those that have solved these infrastructure challenges, like Uber, Facebook and others, all agree that this is an iterative, never-ending process. We’ve covered the generic challenges and will now dive into specific implementations Facebook uses, across hardware and software, when creating their scalable AI/ML infrastructure.Facebook was nice enough to show us the inner workings of how they build and scale ML infrastructure to support over 2 billion users. If you follow Facebook (in real life, not on their social media platforms) you’ll know their openness and willingness to share internal technical details is nothing new as they have a history of sharing innovations and their data center designs with the public through opencompute.org. Their AI platform can be categorized with these primary pillars:Facebook uses machine learning for classification, ranking and content understanding services. These include, but are not limited to, things like your news feed, serving ads, search, classifying objects, identifying people’s faces in posts and language translation from one country’s language to another’s. To build a platform like Facebook’s you will need to work across internal business units to take their use case and have your AI/ML leads select ML algorithms that are “best” for that particular use case. The “best” model being defined by attributes like how interpretable, simple, accurate, fast and scalable the model is. When training these models to achieve the desired accuracy, Facebook asks and answers these questions:Lets now take a look into the hardware that enables these ML use cases.Facebook has been designing their own hardware since 2010. Their hardware design philosophy is to re-imagine hardware, making it more efficient, flexible, and scalable. For their ML infrastructure they identified a small number of major services with unique resource requirements and design servers for those major services, making the hardware available in one global shared pool rather than using customized, dedicated hardware. When building your own infrastructure you will be tasked with typical data center operations (racking, stacking, installing, maintaining, monitoring, patching, etc) while also dealing with ensuring that hardware is performant with ML workloads. Facebook found that designing hardware around a 3-tiered approach for the web, compute/memory and storage tiers was the best approach.The web tier is for, surprise-surprise, stateless web application and services. Through testing they found the web tier processes a lot of I/O and used the Open Compute Yosemite design that holds 12 machines (called Twin Lakes) in a power efficient box with single socket CPUs that best serve the throughput requirements of the web tier.For the compute and memory heavy workloads, they use the Tioga Pass design which is designed for powerful CPUs with the ability to insert large amounts of memory as required by your application. For the storage tier they use the Bryce Canyon design which is great for high throughput storage as the design supports many storage disks.Facebook started with off-the-shelf GPUs in HP servers and then learned about things like serviceability and thermal effects on reliability. After building on their infrastructure knowledge they begin building their own boxes and started with the Open Compute Big Sur design which was later updated it to Big Basin design. A primary difference from Big Sur to Big Basin being they attached a pure GPU box and then isolated the CPU based head node for better reliability. Amazon does something similar by isolating the GPU from the CPU with their Elastic Inference offering, albeit to reduce cost by up to 75% versus Facebook’s serviceability and reliability reasons.We can see how it looks when we map the hardware to the Machine Learning Workflow mentioned earlier. This isn’t the entire picture of their ML infrastructure though so lets move on to software.Now that you’ve mastered the hardware components of your AI/ML infrastructure, you now need to establish the software components such as ML libraries, frameworks and workflow orchestration.Similar to Facebook’s hardware needs, their software needs don’t have a one size fits all ML approach. The principle they use when looking at ML frameworks is to split development and deployment (production) environments. You can see things like flexibility and a developers ability to iterate fast matter more in the development environment where attributes like the framework’s stability and ability to scale to thousands of nodes matter more in production environments. To satisfy both the developers and operations teams they’ve settled on PyTorch and Caffe2. Note that PyTorch and Caffe2 aren’t the only frameworks in use but are the primary ones in use today per Jia.For those not very familiar with this space you may have heard of TensorFlow, created by Google, but not Caffe2. Caffe2 is a newer, lightweight, modular, and scalable deep learning framework that was created and open-sourced by Facebook April 2017 (the “2\" is because there is a Caffe “1” framework created by Jia during his UC Berkeley PhD). For the infrastructure compatibility portion of the framework they focus on making sure it supports the appropriate backend plugins to allow workloads to run efficiently and across multiple platforms. For example the NNPACK, CUDA and cuDNN integration ensures Caffe2 runs well with CPUs and GPUs while the OpenGL ES and Qualcomm integration helps when deploying to mobile. Facebook also created and then integrated into Caffe2, Tensor Comprehension, which shortens typical workflow for creating new high-performance machine learning (ML) layers. During testing they found this drops workflow times from days or weeks to just minutes through automatically optimizing based on underlying hardware characteristics.During the experimentation phase, Facebook found frameworks like Caffe2 and TensorFlow were too hard to debug and developers were more comfortable with Python. To accommodate developers they created PyTorch, an open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment. PyTorch makes Python a first class citizen allowing those comfortable with Numpy, a popular Python package for scientific computing, to easily integrate with PyTorch. Developers also get the typical Python errors they are used to from PyTorch, which simplifies the debugging process.Based on their Twitter feedback, this approach seems to be working effectively.Your next question may be, “Two frameworks, how do they get models from the development framework to the production framework?” which Facebook thought of also and collaborated with Amazon and Microsoft to create ONNX, an Open Neural Network Exchange. ONNX is an open format to enable developers to more easily move models between one ML framework to another. Outside of the ML frameworks, ONNX also standardizes portability across converters, runtimes, compilers and visualizers. supports and to .The image above shows creating an ONNX model with a ML framework of choice and then deploying to CPU, GPU or Arm based hardware without having to make any vendor specific changes as the vendors in that graphic all support ONNX models. Another workflow could be one developer creating a model in TensorFlow, handing it off to another developer using Caffe2 and then the Caffe2 developer using the same model and deploying it to Apple devices (Apple CoreML) and NVIDIA based GPU servers (Nvidia TensorRT).Even after establishing the frameworks you want to use, you still need an orchestration engine to assist with the entire ML workflow. To manage the ML workflow Facebook created FB Leaner.FB Leaner has three primary components for processing Facebook’s Machine Learning WorkflowPutting it all together, this is how Facebook’s scalable AI/ML infrastructure looks with the hardware and software components discussed in this article.A key takeaway, whether your focus is on hardware or software, is that building an ML platform from scratch that can scales to millions or billions of users is difficult. To do it like Facebook a few of the things you’d have to do is:Oh, and manage that AI/ML infrastructure that scales globally to service over two billion people with a team of 17.If you enjoyed this article, please tap the claps 👏 button.Interested in learning more about Jamal Robinson or want to work together?
